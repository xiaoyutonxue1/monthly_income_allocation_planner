This plugin switches Babel to use `hermes-parser` instead of the `@babel/parser`. Since Hermes parser uses C++ compiled to WASM it is significantly faster and provides full syntax support for Flow.\n\n## Install\n\nUsing npm:\n\n```sh\nnpm install --save-dev babel-plugin-syntax-hermes-parser\n```\n\nor using yarn:\n\n```sh\nyarn add babel-plugin-syntax-hermes-parser --dev\n```\n\n# Usage\n\nThe plugin can be enabled via:\n\n```\n// babel.config.json\n{\n  \"plugins\": [\"babel-plugin-syntax-hermes-parser\"]\n}\n```\n\nIf parser options need to be provide you can do so via the `parserOpts` config:\n\n```\n// babel.config.json\n{\n  \"plugins\": [\"babel-plugin-syntax-hermes-parser\"],\n  \"parserOpts\": {\n    \"allowReturnOutsideFunction\": true\n  }\n}\n```\n","readmeFilename":"README.md"}
