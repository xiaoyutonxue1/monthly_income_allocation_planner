Vulnerabilities][snyk-image]][snyk-url] [![downloads][downloads-image]][downloads-url] \n\n\n<img src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4672033/107800563-adb9ce00-6d3d-11eb-8425-2256d0278894.png\" align=right height=200>\n\nLaunch Microsoft Edge with ease from Node.js.\n\n* [Disables many Edge services](https://github.com/cezaraugusto/chromium-edge-launcher/blob/master/src/flags.ts) that add noise to automated scenarios.\n* Opens up the browser's `remote-debugging-port` on an available port.\n* Automagically locates a Edge binary to launch.\n* Uses a fresh Edge profile for each launch, and cleans itself up on `kill()`.\n* Binds `Ctrl-C` (by default) to terminate the Edge process.\n* Exposes a small set of [options](#api) for configurability over these details.\n\n### Installing\n\n```sh\nyarn add chromium-edge-launcher\n\n# or with npm:\nnpm install chromium-edge-launcher\n```\n\n## API\n\n### `.launch([opts])`\n\n#### Launch options\n\n```js\n{\n  // (optional) remote debugging port number to use.\n  // If provided port is already busy, launch() will reject.\n  // Default: an available port is autoselected\n  port: number;\n\n  // (optional) Additional flags to pass to Edge,\n  // for example: ['--headless', '--disable-gpu'].\n  // See: https://github.com/cezaraugusto/chromium-edge-launcher/blob/main/docs/edge-flags-for-tools.md\n  // Do note, many flags are set by default.\n  // See https://github.com/cezaraugusto/chromium-edge-launcher/blob/master/src/flags.ts\n  edgeFlags: Array<string>;\n\n  // (optional) Close the Edge process on `Ctrl-C`.\n  // Default: true\n  handleSIGINT: boolean;\n\n  // (optional) Explicit path of intended Edge binary.\n  // * If this `edgePath` option is defined, it will be used.\n  // * Otherwise, the `EDGE_PATH` env variable will be used if set.\n  // (`LIGHTHOUSE_CHROMIUM_PATH` is deprecated)\n  // * Otherwise, a detected Edge Canary will be used if found.\n  // * Otherwise, a detected Edge (stable) will be used.\n  edgePath: string;\n\n  // (optional) Edge profile path to use, if set to `false` then\n  // the default profile will be used.\n  // Default: a fresh Edge profile.\n  userDataDir: string | boolean;\n\n  // (optional) Starting URL to open the browser with\n  // Default: `about:blank`\n  startingUrl: string;\n\n  // (optional) Logging level\n  // Default: 'silent'\n  logLevel: 'verbose'|'info'|'error'|'silent';\n\n  // (optional) Flags specific in [flags.ts](src/flags.ts) will\n  // not be included. Typically used with the defaultFlags() method\n  // and edgeFlags option.\n  // Default: false\n  ignoreDefaultFlags: boolean;\n\n  // (optional) Interval in ms, which defines how often launcher checks\n  // browser port to be ready.\n  // Default: 500\n  connectionPollInterval: number;\n\n  // (optional) A number of retries, before browser launch\n  // considered unsuccessful.\n  // Default: 50\n  maxConnectionRetries: number;\n\n  // (optional) A dict of environmental key value pairs to pass to\n  // the spawned edge process.\n  envVars: {[key: string]: string};\n};\n```\n\n#### Launched edge interface\n\n#### `.launch().then(edge => ...`\n\n```js\n// The remote debugging port exposed by the launched edge\nedge.port: number;\n\n// Method to kill Edge (and cleanup the profile folder)\nedge.kill: () => Promise<void>;\n\n// The process id\nedge.pid: number;\n\n// The childProcess object for the launched Edge\nedge.process: childProcess\n```\n\n### `EdgeLauncher.Launcher.defaultFlags()`\n\nReturns an `Array<string>` of the default [flags](docs/edge-flags-for-tools.md) Edge is launched with. Typically used along with the `ignoreDefaultFlags` and `edgeFlags` options.\n\nNote: This array will exclude the following flags: `--remote-debugging-port` `--disable-setuid-sandbox` `--user-data-dir`.\n\n### `EdgeLauncher.Launcher.getInstallations()`\n\nReturns an `Array<string>` of paths to available Edge installations. When `edgePath` is not provided to `.launch()`, the first installation returned from this method is used instead.\n\nNote: This method performs synchronous I/O operations.\n\n### `.killAll()`\n\nAttempts to kill all Edge instances created with [`.launch([opts])`](#launchopts). Returns a Promise that resolves to an array of errors that occurred while killing instances. If all instances were killed successfully, the array will be empty.\n\n```js\nconst EdgeLauncher = require('chromium-edge-launcher');\n\nasync function cleanup() {\n  await EdgeLauncher.killAll();\n}\n```\n\n## Examples\n\n#### Launching Edge:\n\n```js\nconst EdgeLauncher = require('chromium-edge-launcher');\n\nEdgeLauncher.launch({\n  startingUrl: 'https://google.com'\n}).then(edge => {\n  console.log(`Edge debugging port running on ${edge.port}`);\n});\n```\n\n\n#### Launching headless Edge:\n\n```js\nconst EdgeLauncher = require('chromium-edge-launcher');\n\nEdgeLauncher.launch({\n  startingUrl: 'https://google.com',\n  edgeFlags: ['--headless', '--disable-gpu']\n}).then(edge => {\n  console.log(`Edge debugging port running on ${edge.port}`);\n});\n```\n\n#### Launching with support for extensions and audio:\n\n```js\nconst EdgeLauncher = require('chromium-edge-launcher');\n\nconst newFlags = EdgeLauncher.Launcher.defaultFlags().filter(flag => flag !== '--disable-extensions' && flag !== '--mute-audio');\n\nEdgeLauncher.launch({\n  ignoreDefaultFlags: true,\n  edgeFlags: newFlags,\n}).then(edge => { ... });\n```\n\n### Continuous Integration\n\nIn a CI environment like Travis, Edge may not be installed. If you want to use `chromium-edge-launcher`, Travis can [install Edge at run time with an addon](https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/edge).  Alternatively, you can also install Edge using the [`download-edge.sh`](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cezaraugusto/chromium-edge-launcher/v0.8.0/scripts/download-edge.sh) script.\n\nThen in `.travis.yml`, use it like so:\n\n```yaml\nlanguage: node_js\ninstall:\n  - yarn install\nbefore_script:\n  - export DISPLAY=:99.0\n  - export CHROME_PATH=\"$(pwd)/edge-linux/edge\"\n  - sh -e /etc/init.d/xvfb start\n  - sleep 3 # wait for xvfb to boot\n\naddons:\n  edge: stable\n```\n\n## Acknowledgements\n\nThis project started as a fork of [Chrome Launcher](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/chrome-launcher), which is released under the Apache-2.0 License, and is copyright of Google Inc.
