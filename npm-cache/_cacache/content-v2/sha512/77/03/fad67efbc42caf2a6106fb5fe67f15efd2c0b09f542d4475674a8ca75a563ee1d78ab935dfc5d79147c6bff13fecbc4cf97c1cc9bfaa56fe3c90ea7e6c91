Framework](https://reduxframework.com/).)\n\nIt helps you write applications that behave consistently, run in different environments (client, server, and native), and are easy to test. On top of that, it provides a great developer experience, such as [live code editing combined with a time traveling debugger](https://github.com/gaearon/redux-devtools).\n\nYou can use Redux together with [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/), or with any other view library.  \nIt is tiny (2kB, including dependencies).\n\n[![build status](https://img.shields.io/travis/reactjs/redux/master.svg?style=flat-square)](https://travis-ci.org/reactjs/redux)\n[![npm version](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/redux.svg?style=flat-square)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/redux)\n[![npm downloads](https://img.shields.io/npm/dm/redux.svg?style=flat-square)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/redux)\n[![redux channel on discord](https://img.shields.io/badge/discord-%23redux%20%40%20reactiflux-61dafb.svg?style=flat-square)](https://discord.gg/0ZcbPKXt5bZ6au5t)\n[![#rackt on freenode](https://img.shields.io/badge/irc-%23rackt%20%40%20freenode-61DAFB.svg?style=flat-square)](https://webchat.freenode.net/)\n[![Changelog #187](https://img.shields.io/badge/changelog-%23187-lightgrey.svg?style=flat-square)](https://changelog.com/187)\n\n>**Learn Redux from its creator:**  \n>**[Part 1: Getting Started with Redux](https://egghead.io/series/getting-started-with-redux) (30 free videos)**<br>\n>**[Part 2: Building React Applications with Idiomatic Redux](https://egghead.io/courses/building-react-applications-with-idiomatic-redux) (27 free videos)**\n\n## Testimonials\n\n>[“Love what you're doing with Redux”](https://twitter.com/jingc/status/616608251463909376)  \n>Jing Chen, creator of Flux\n\n>[“I asked for comments on Redux in FB's internal JS discussion group, and it was universally praised. Really awesome work.”](https://twitter.com/fisherwebdev/status/616286955693682688)  \n>Bill Fisher, author of Flux documentation\n\n>[“It's cool that you are inventing a better Flux by not doing Flux at all.”](https://twitter.com/andrestaltz/status/616271392930201604)  \n>André Staltz, creator of Cycle\n\n## Before Proceeding Further\n\n>**Also read:**  \n>**[You Might Not Need Redux](https://medium.com/@dan_abramov/you-might-not-need-redux-be46360cf367)**\n\n## Developer Experience\n\nI wrote Redux while working on my React Europe talk called [“Hot Reloading with Time Travel”](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsSnOQynTHs). My goal was to create a state management library with minimal API but completely predictable behavior, so it is possible to implement logging, hot reloading, time travel, universal apps, record and replay, without any buy-in from the developer.\n\n## Influences\n\nRedux evolves the ideas of [Flux](http://facebook.github.io/flux/), but avoids its complexity by taking cues from [Elm](https://github.com/evancz/elm-architecture-tutorial/).  \nWhether you have used them or not, Redux only takes a few minutes to get started with.\n\n## Installation\n\nTo install the stable version:\n\n```\nnpm install --save redux\n```\n\nThis assumes you are using [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) as your package manager.  \n\nIf you're not, you can [access these files on unpkg](https://unpkg.com/redux/), download them, or point your package manager to them.\n\nMost commonly people consume Redux as a collection of [CommonJS](http://webpack.github.io/docs/commonjs.html) modules. These modules are what you get when you import `redux` in a [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/), [Browserify](http://browserify.org/), or a Node environment. If you like to live on the edge and use [Rollup](http://rollupjs.org), we support that as well.\n\nIf you don't use a module bundler, it's also fine. The `redux` npm package includes precompiled production and development [UMD](https://github.com/umdjs/umd) builds in the [`dist` folder](https://unpkg.com/redux/dist/). They can be used directly without a bundler and are thus compatible with many popular JavaScript module loaders and environments. For example, you can drop a UMD build as a [`<script>` tag](https://unpkg.com/redux/dist/redux.js) on the page, or [tell Bower to install it](https://github.com/reactjs/redux/pull/1181#issuecomment-167361975). The UMD builds make Redux available as a `window.Redux` global variable.\n\nThe Redux source code is written in ES2015 but we precompile both CommonJS and UMD builds to ES5 so they work in [any modern browser](http://caniuse.com/#feat=es5). You don't need to use Babel or a module bundler to [get started with Redux](https://github.com/reactjs/redux/blob/master/examples/counter-vanilla/index.html).\n\n### Complementary Packages\n\nMost likely, you'll also need [the React bindings](https://github.com/reactjs/react-redux) and [the developer tools](https://github.com/gaearon/redux-devtools).\n\n```\nnpm install --save react-redux\nnpm install --save-dev redux-devtools\n```\n\nNote that unlike Redux itself, many packages in the Redux ecosystem don't provide UMD builds, so we recommend using CommonJS module bundlers like [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/) and [Browserify](http://browserify.org/) for the most comfortable development experience.\n\n## The Gist\n\nThe whole state of your app is stored in an object tree inside a single *store*.  \nThe only way to change the state tree is to emit an *action*, an object describing what happened.  \nTo specify how the actions transform the state tree, you write pure *reducers*.\n\nThat's it!\n\n```js\nimport { createStore } from 'redux'\n\n/**\n * This is a reducer, a pure function with (state, action) => state signature.\n * It describes how an action transforms the state into the next state.\n *\n * The shape of the state is up to you: it can be a primitive, an array, an object,\n * or even an Immutable.js data structure. The only important part is that you should\n * not mutate the state object, but return a new object if the state changes.\n *\n * In this example, we use a `switch` statement and strings, but you can use a helper that\n * follows a different convention (such as function maps) if it makes sense for your\n * project.\n */\nfunction counter(state = 0, action) {\n  switch (action.type) {\n  case 'INCREMENT':\n    return state + 1\n  case 'DECREMENT':\n    return state - 1\n  default:\n    return state\n  }\n}\n\n// Create a Redux store holding the state of your app.\n// Its API is { subscribe, dispatch, getState }.\nlet store = createStore(counter)\n\n// You can use subscribe() to update the UI in response to state changes.\n// Normally you'd use a view binding library (e.g. React Redux) rather than subscribe() directly.\n// However it can also be handy to persist the current state in the localStorage.\n\nstore.subscribe(() =>\n  console.log(store.getState())\n)\n\n// The only way to mutate the internal state is to dispatch an action.\n// The actions can be serialized, logged or stored and later replayed.\nstore.dispatch({ type: 'INCREMENT' })\n// 1\nstore.dispatch({ type: 'INCREMENT' })\n// 2\nstore.dispatch({ type: 'DECREMENT' })\n// 1\n```\n\nInstead of mutating the state directly, you specify the mutations you want to happen with plain objects called *actions*. Then you write a special function called a *reducer* to decide how every action transforms the entire application's state.\n\nIf you're coming from Flux, there is a single important difference you need to understand. Redux doesn't have a Dispatcher or support many stores. Instead, there is just a single store with a single root reducing function. As your app grows, instead of adding stores, you split the root reducer into smaller reducers independently operating on the different parts of the state tree. This is exactly like how there is just one root component in a React app, but it is composed out of many small components.\n\nThis architecture might seem like an overkill for a counter app, but the beauty of this pattern is how well it scales to large and complex apps. It also enables very powerful developer tools, because it is possible to trace every mutation to the action that caused it. You can record user sessions and reproduce them just by replaying every action.\n\n## Learn Redux from Its Creator\n\n[Getting Started with Redux](https://egghead.io/series/getting-started-with-redux) is a video course consisting of 30 videos narrated by Dan Abramov, author of Redux.

Framework](https://reduxframework.com/).)\n\nIt helps you write applications that behave consistently, run in different environments (client, server, and native), and are easy to test. On top of that, it provides a great developer experience, such as [live code editing combined with a time traveling debugger](https://github.com/gaearon/redux-devtools).\n\nYou can use Redux together with [React](https://reactjs.org), or with any other view library.  \nIt is tiny (2kB, including dependencies).\n\n[![build status](https://img.shields.io/travis/reactjs/redux/master.svg?style=flat-square)](https://travis-ci.org/reactjs/redux)\n[![npm version](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/redux.svg?style=flat-square)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/redux)\n[![npm downloads](https://img.shields.io/npm/dm/redux.svg?style=flat-square)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/redux)\n[![redux channel on discord](https://img.shields.io/badge/discord-%23redux%20%40%20reactiflux-61dafb.svg?style=flat-square)](https://discord.gg/0ZcbPKXt5bZ6au5t)\n[![Changelog #187](https://img.shields.io/badge/changelog-%23187-lightgrey.svg?style=flat-square)](https://changelog.com/187)\n\n\n## Learn Redux\n\nWe have a variety of resources available to help you learn Redux, no matter what your background or learning style is.\n\n### Just the Basics\n\nIf you're brand new to Redux and want to understand the basic concepts, see:\n\n- The **[basic tutorial in the Redux docs](https://redux.js.org/basics)**\n- Redux creator Dan Abramov's **free [\"Getting Started with Redux\" video series](https://egghead.io/series/getting-started-with-redux)** on Egghead.io\n- Redux co-maintainer Mark Erikson's **[\"Redux Fundamentals\" slideshow](http://blog.isquaredsoftware.com/2018/03/presentation-reactathon-redux-fundamentals/)** and **[list of suggested resources for learning Redux](http://blog.isquaredsoftware.com/2017/12/blogged-answers-learn-redux/)**\n- If you learn best by looking at code and playing with it, check out our list of **[Redux example applications](https://redux.js.org/introduction/examples)**, available as separate projects in the Redux repo, and also as interactive online examples on CodeSandbox.\n- The **[Redux Tutorials](https://github.com/markerikson/react-redux-links/blob/master/redux-tutorials.md)** section of the **[React/Redux links list](https://github.com/markerikson/react-redux-links)**.

Reactiflux is a great place to hang out, ask questions, and learn - come join us!\n\n\n\n\n## Before Proceeding Further\n\nRedux is a valuable tool for organizing your state, but you should also consider whether it's appropriate for your situation.  Don't use Redux just because someone said you should - take some time to understand the potential benefits and tradeoffs of using it.\n\nHere's some suggestions on when it makes sense to use Redux:\n* You have reasonable amounts of data changing over time\n* You need a single source of truth for your state\n* You find that keeping all your state in a top-level component is no longer sufficient\n\nYes, these guidelines are subjective and vague, but this is for good reason. The point at which you should integrate Redux into your application is different for every user and different for every application.\n\n>**For more thoughts on how Redux is meant to be used, see:**<br>\n>- **[You Might Not Need Redux](https://medium.com/@dan_abramov/you-might-not-need-redux-be46360cf367)**<br>\n>- **[The Tao of Redux, Part 1 - Implementation and Intent](http://blog.isquaredsoftware.com/2017/05/idiomatic-redux-tao-of-redux-part-1/)**<br>\n>- **[The Tao of Redux, Part 2 - Practice and Philosophy](http://blog.isquaredsoftware.com/2017/05/idiomatic-redux-tao-of-redux-part-2/)**\n>- **[Redux FAQ](https://redux.js.org/faq)**\n\n## Developer Experience\n\nDan Abramov (author of Redux) wrote Redux while working on his React Europe talk called [“Hot Reloading with Time Travel”](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsSnOQynTHs). His goal was to create a state management library with minimal API but completely predictable behavior, so it is possible to implement logging, hot reloading, time travel, universal apps, record and replay, without any buy-in from the developer.\n\n## Influences\n\nRedux evolves the ideas of [Flux](http://facebook.github.io/flux/), but avoids its complexity by taking cues from [Elm](https://github.com/evancz/elm-architecture-tutorial/).  \nWhether you have used them or not, Redux only takes a few minutes to get started with.\n\n## Installation\n\nTo install the stable version:\n\n```\nnpm install --save redux\n```\n\nThis assumes you are using [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) as your package manager.  \n\nIf you're not, you can [access these files on unpkg](https://unpkg.com/redux/), download them, or point your package manager to them.\n\nMost commonly people consume Redux as a collection of [CommonJS](http://webpack.github.io/docs/commonjs.html) modules. These modules are what you get when you import `redux` in a [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/), [Browserify](http://browserify.org/), or a Node environment. If you like to live on the edge and use [Rollup](http://rollupjs.org), we support that as well.\n\nIf you don't use a module bundler, it's also fine. The `redux` npm package includes precompiled production and development [UMD](https://github.com/umdjs/umd) builds in the [`dist` folder](https://unpkg.com/redux/dist/). They can be used directly without a bundler and are thus compatible with many popular JavaScript module loaders and environments. For example, you can drop a UMD build as a [`<script>` tag](https://unpkg.com/redux/dist/redux.js) on the page, or [tell Bower to install it](https://github.com/reactjs/redux/pull/1181#issuecomment-167361975). The UMD builds make Redux available as a `window.Redux` global variable.\n\nThe Redux source code is written in ES2015 but we precompile both CommonJS and UMD builds to ES5 so they work in [any modern browser](http://caniuse.com/#feat=es5). You don't need to use Babel or a module bundler to [get started with Redux](https://github.com/reactjs/redux/blob/master/examples/counter-vanilla/index.html).\n\n### Complementary Packages\n\nMost likely, you'll also need [the React bindings](https://github.com/reactjs/react-redux) and [the developer tools](https://github.com/gaearon/redux-devtools).\n\n```\nnpm install --save react-redux\nnpm install --save-dev redux-devtools\n```\n\nNote that unlike Redux itself, many packages in the Redux ecosystem don't provide UMD builds, so we recommend using CommonJS module bundlers like [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/) and [Browserify](http://browserify.org/) for the most comfortable development experience.\n\n## The Gist\n\nThe whole state of your app is stored in an object tree inside a single *store*.  \nThe only way to change the state tree is to emit an *action*, an object describing what happened.  \nTo specify how the actions transform the state tree, you write pure *reducers*.\n\nThat's it!\n\n```js\nimport { createStore } from 'redux'\n\n/**\n * This is a reducer, a pure function with (state, action) => state signature.\n * It describes how an action transforms the state into the next state.\n *\n * The shape of the state is up to you: it can be a primitive, an array, an object,\n * or even an Immutable.js data structure. The only important part is that you should\n * not mutate the state object, but return a new object if the state changes.\n *\n * In this example, we use a `switch` statement and strings, but you can use a helper that\n * follows a different convention (such as function maps) if it makes sense for your\n * project.\n */\nfunction counter(state = 0, action) {\n  switch (action.type) {\n  case 'INCREMENT':\n    return state + 1\n  case 'DECREMENT':\n    return state - 1\n  default:\n    return state\n  }\n}\n\n// Create a Redux store holding the state of your app.\n// Its API is { subscribe, dispatch, getState }.\nlet store = createStore(counter)\n\n// You can use subscribe() to update the UI in response to state changes.\n// Normally you'd use a view binding library (e.g. React Redux) rather than subscribe() directly.\n// However it can also be handy to persist the current state in the localStorage.\n\nstore.subscribe(() =>\n  console.log(store.getState())\n)\n\n// The only way to mutate the internal state is to dispatch an action.\n// The actions can be serialized, logged or stored and later replayed.\nstore.dispatch({ type: 'INCREMENT' })\n// 1\nstore.dispatch({ type: 'INCREMENT' })\n// 2\nstore.dispatch({ type: 'DECREMENT' })\n// 1\n```\n\nInstead of mutating the state directly, you specify the mutations you want to happen with plain objects called *actions*. Then you write a special function called a *reducer* to decide how every action transforms the entire application's state.\n\nIf you're coming from Flux, there is a single important difference you need to understand. Redux doesn't have a Dispatcher or support many stores. Instead, there is just a single store with a single root reducing function. As your app grows, instead of adding stores, you split the root reducer into smaller reducers independently operating on the different parts of the state tree. This is exactly like how there is just one root component in a React app, but it is composed out of many small components.\n\nThis architecture might seem like an overkill for a counter app, but the beauty of this pattern is how well it scales to large and complex apps. It also enables very powerful developer tools, because it is possible to trace every mutation to the action that caused it. You can record user sessions and reproduce them just by replaying every action.\n\n## Learn Redux from Its Authors\n\n### Redux Video Tutorials by Dan Abramov\n\n#### Getting Started with Redux\n**[Getting Started with Redux](https://egghead.io/series/getting-started-with-redux)** is a video course consisting of 30 videos narrated by [Dan Abramov](https://twitter.com/dan_abramov), author of Redux. It is designed to complement the “Basics” part of the docs while bringing additional insights about immutability, testing, Redux best practices, and using Redux with React. **This course is free and will always be.**\n\n>[“Great course on egghead.io by @dan_abramov - instead of just showing you how to use #redux, it also shows how and why redux was built!”](https://twitter.com/sandrinodm/status/670548531422326785)  \n>Sandrino Di Mattia\n\n>[“Plowing through @dan_abramov 'Getting Started with Redux' - its amazing how much simpler concepts get with video.”](https://twitter.com/chrisdhanaraj/status/670328025553219584)  \n>Chris Dhanaraj\n\n>[“This video series on Redux by @dan_abramov on @eggheadio is spectacular!”](https://twitter.com/eddiezane/status/670333133242408960)  \n>Eddie Zaneski\n\n>[“Come for the name hype. Stay for the rock solid fundamentals. (Thanks, and great job @dan_abramov and @eggheadio!)”](https://twitter.com/danott/status/669909126554607617)  \n>Dan\n\n>[“This series of videos on Redux by @dan_abramov is repeatedly blowing my mind - gunna do some serious refactoring”](https://twitter.com/gelatindesign/status/669658358643892224)  \n>Laurence Roberts\n\nSo, what are you waiting for?\n\n#### [Watch the free \"Getting Started with Redux\" video series](https://egghead.io/series/getting-started-with-redux)\n\n> Note: If you enjoyed Dan's course, consider supporting Egghead by [buying a subscription](https://egghead.io/pricing). Subscribers have access to the source code of every example in my videos and tons of advanced lessons on other topics, including JavaScript in depth, React, Angular, and more. Many [Egghead instructors](https://egghead.io/instructors) are also open source library authors, so buying a subscription is a nice way to thank them for the work that they've done.\n\n\n#### Building React Applications with Idiomatic Redux\n\nThe **[Building React Applications with Idiomatic Redux](https://egghead.io/courses/building-react-applications-with-idiomatic-redux)** course is a second free video series by Dan Abramov.  It picks up where the first series left off, and covers practical production ready techniques for building your React and Redux applications: advanced state management, middleware, React Router integration, and other common problems you are likely to encounter while building applications for your clients and customers.  As with the first series, **this course will always be free**.\n\n\n#### [Watch the free \"Idiomatic Redux\" video series](https://egghead.io/courses/building-react-applications-with-idiomatic-redux)\n\n\n\n### Practical Redux course\n\n**[Practical Redux](https://www.educative.io/collection/5687753853370368/5707702298738688/)** is a paid interactive course by Redux co-maintainer [Mark Erikson](https://twitter.com/acemarke).  The course is designed to show how to apply the basic concepts of Redux to building something larger than a TodoMVC application.  It includes real-world topics like:\n\n\n- Adding Redux to a new Create-React-App project and configuring Hot Module Replacement for faster development \n- Controling your UI behavior with Redux \n- Using the Redux-ORM library to manage relational data in your Redux store \n- Building a master/detail view to display and edit data \n- Writing custom advanced Redux reducer logic to solve specific problems \n- Optimizing performance of Redux-connected form inputs \n\nAnd much more!  \n\nThe course is based on Mark's original free **[\"Practical Redux\" blog tutorial series](http://blog.isquaredsoftware.com/series/practical-redux/)**, but with updated and improved content.\n\n\n### Redux Workshops\n\nRedux co-maintainer [Mark Erikson](https://twitter.com/acemarke) has partnered with [Workshop.me](https://workshop.me/) to teach a series of Redux workshops.\n\nThe first [**Redux Fundamentals** workshop will be held in New York City, April 19-20](https://workshop.me/2018-04-react-redux?a=mark), and will cover:\n\n- The history and purpose of Redux\n- Reducers, actions, and working with a Redux store\n- Using Redux with React\n- Using and writing Redux middleware\n- Working with AJAX calls and other side effects\n- Unit testing Redux apps\n- Real-world Redux app structure and development\n\nTickets are still available, and [can be purchased through Workshop.me](https://workshop.me/2018-04-react-redux?a=mark).\n\n\n## Documentation\n\n* [Introduction](http://redux.js.org/introduction/index.html)\n* [Basics](http://redux.js.org/basics/index.html)\n* [Advanced](http://redux.js.org/advanced/index.html)\n* [Recipes](http://redux.js.org/recipes/index.html)\n* [FAQ](http://redux.js.org/FAQ.html)\n* [Troubleshooting](http://redux.js.org/Troubleshooting.html)\n* [Glossary](http://redux.js.org/Glossary.html)\n* [API Reference](http://redux.js.org/api/index.html)\n\nFor PDF, ePub, and MOBI exports for offline reading, and instructions on how to create them, please see: [paulkogel/redux-offline-docs](https://github.com/paulkogel/redux-offline-docs).\n\nFor Offline docs, please see: [devdocs](http://devdocs.io/redux/)\n\n## Examples\n\nAlmost all examples have a corresponding CodeSandbox sandbox.

Framework](https://reduxframework.com/).)\n\nIt helps you write applications that behave consistently, run in different environments (client, server, and native), and are easy to test. On top of that, it provides a great developer experience, such as [live code editing combined with a time traveling debugger](https://github.com/reduxjs/redux-devtools).\n\nYou can use Redux together with [React](https://reactjs.org), or with any other view library.  \nIt is tiny (2kB, including dependencies).\n\n> **Note**: We are currently planning a rewrite of the Redux docs. Please take some time to **[fill out this survey on what content is most important in a docs site](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfzIkY3fXZ8PrQKScYMK0YoEgALfAK2qQ0mOj1_ibKv2qDTuQ/viewform)**.

Don't use Redux just because someone said you should - take some time to understand the potential benefits and tradeoffs of using it.\n\nHere are some suggestions on when it makes sense to use Redux:\n\n- You have reasonable amounts of data changing over time\n- You need a single source of truth for your state\n- You find that keeping all your state in a top-level component is no longer sufficient\n\nYes, these guidelines are subjective and vague, but this is for good reason. The point at which you should integrate Redux into your application is different for every user and different for every application.\n\n> **For more thoughts on how Redux is meant to be used, see:**<br>\n>\n> - **[You Might Not Need Redux](https://medium.com/@dan_abramov/you-might-not-need-redux-be46360cf367)**<br>\n> - **[The Tao of Redux, Part 1 - Implementation and Intent](http://blog.isquaredsoftware.com/2017/05/idiomatic-redux-tao-of-redux-part-1/)**<br>\n> - **[The Tao of Redux, Part 2 - Practice and Philosophy](http://blog.isquaredsoftware.com/2017/05/idiomatic-redux-tao-of-redux-part-2/)**\n> - **[Redux FAQ](https://redux.js.org/faq)**\n\n## Developer Experience\n\nDan Abramov (author of Redux) wrote Redux while working on his React Europe talk called [“Hot Reloading with Time Travel”](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsSnOQynTHs). His goal was to create a state management library with a minimal API but completely predictable behavior. Redux makes it possible to implement logging, hot reloading, time travel, universal apps, record and replay, without any buy-in from the developer.\n\n## Influences\n\nRedux evolves the ideas of [Flux](http://facebook.github.io/flux/), but avoids its complexity by taking cues from [Elm](https://github.com/evancz/elm-architecture-tutorial/).  \nEven if you haven't used Flux or Elm, Redux only takes a few minutes to get started with.\n\n## Installation\n\nTo install the stable version:\n\n```sh\nnpm install --save redux\n```\n\nThis assumes you are using [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) as your package manager.\n\nIf you're not, you can [access these files on unpkg](https://unpkg.com/redux/), download them, or point your package manager to them.\n\nMost commonly, people consume Redux as a collection of [CommonJS](https://github.com/webpack/docs/wiki/commonjs) modules. These modules are what you get when you import `redux` in a [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/), [Browserify](http://browserify.org/), or a Node environment. If you like to live on the edge and use [Rollup](https://rollupjs.org), we support that as well.\n\nIf you don't use a module bundler, it's also fine. The `redux` npm package includes precompiled production and development [UMD](https://github.com/umdjs/umd) builds in the [`dist` folder](https://unpkg.com/redux/dist/). They can be used directly without a bundler and are thus compatible with many popular JavaScript module loaders and environments. For example, you can drop a UMD build as a [`<script>` tag](https://unpkg.com/redux/dist/redux.js) on the page, or [tell Bower to install it](https://github.com/reduxjs/redux/pull/1181#issuecomment-167361975). The UMD builds make Redux available as a `window.Redux` global variable.\n\nThe Redux source code is written in ES2015 but we precompile both CommonJS and UMD builds to ES5 so they work in [any modern browser](http://caniuse.com/#feat=es5). You don't need to use Babel or a module bundler to [get started with Redux](https://github.com/reduxjs/redux/blob/master/examples/counter-vanilla/index.html). You can even use the ES module build that's available at [`es/redux.mjs`](https://unpkg.com/redux/es/) which can be referenced using `type=\"module\"` in your `script` tag or as a standard `import`.\n\n### Complementary Packages\n\nMost likely, you'll also need [the React bindings](https://github.com/reduxjs/react-redux) and [the developer tools](https://github.com/reduxjs/redux-devtools).\n\n```sh\nnpm install --save react-redux\nnpm install --save-dev redux-devtools\n```\n\nNote that unlike Redux itself, many packages in the Redux ecosystem don't provide UMD builds, so we recommend using CommonJS module bundlers like [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/) and [Browserify](http://browserify.org/) for the most comfortable development experience.\n\n## The Gist\n\nThe whole state of your app is stored in an object tree inside a single _store_.  \nThe only way to change the state tree is to emit an _action_, an object describing what happened.  \nTo specify how the actions transform the state tree, you write pure _reducers_.\n\nThat's it!\n\n```js\nimport { createStore } from 'redux'\n\n/**\n * This is a reducer, a pure function with (state, action) => state signature.\n * It describes how an action transforms the state into the next state.\n *\n * The shape of the state is up to you: it can be a primitive, an array, an object,\n * or even an Immutable.js data structure. The only important part is that you should\n * not mutate the state object, but return a new object if the state changes.\n *\n * In this example, we use a `switch` statement and strings, but you can use a helper that\n * follows a different convention (such as function maps) if it makes sense for your\n * project.\n */\nfunction counter(state = 0, action) {\n  switch (action.type) {\n    case 'INCREMENT':\n      return state + 1\n    case 'DECREMENT':\n      return state - 1\n    default:\n      return state\n  }\n}\n\n// Create a Redux store holding the state of your app.\n// Its API is { subscribe, dispatch, getState }.\nlet store = createStore(counter)\n\n// You can use subscribe() to update the UI in response to state changes.\n// Normally you'd use a view binding library (e.g. React Redux) rather than subscribe() directly.\n// However it can also be handy to persist the current state in the localStorage.\n\nstore.subscribe(() => console.log(store.getState()))\n\n// The only way to mutate the internal state is to dispatch an action.\n// The actions can be serialized, logged or stored and later replayed.\nstore.dispatch({ type: 'INCREMENT' })\n// 1\nstore.dispatch({ type: 'INCREMENT' })\n// 2\nstore.dispatch({ type: 'DECREMENT' })\n// 1\n```\n\nInstead of mutating the state directly, you specify the mutations you want to happen with plain objects called _actions_. Then you write a special function called a _reducer_ to decide how every action transforms the entire application's state.\n\nIf you're coming from Flux, there is a single important difference you need to understand. Redux doesn't have a Dispatcher or support many stores. Instead, there is just a single store with a single root reducing function. As your app grows, instead of adding stores, you split the root reducer into smaller reducers independently operating on the different parts of the state tree. This is exactly like how there is just one root component in a React app, but it is composed out of many small components.\n\nThis architecture might seem like an overkill for a counter app, but the beauty of this pattern is how well it scales to large and complex apps. It also enables very powerful developer tools, because it is possible to trace every mutation to the action that caused it. You can record user sessions and reproduce them just by replaying every action.\n\n## Learn Redux from Its Authors\n\n### Redux Video Tutorials by Dan Abramov\n\n#### Getting Started with Redux\n\n**[Getting Started with Redux](https://egghead.io/series/getting-started-with-redux)** is a video course consisting of 30 videos narrated by [Dan Abramov](https://twitter.com/dan_abramov), author of Redux.

The course is designed to show how to apply the basic concepts of Redux to building something larger than a TodoMVC application. It includes real-world topics like:\n\n- Adding Redux to a new Create-React-App project and configuring Hot Module Replacement for faster development\n- Controlling your UI behavior with Redux\n- Using the Redux-ORM library to manage relational data in your Redux store\n- Building a master/detail view to display and edit data\n- Writing custom advanced Redux reducer logic to solve specific problems\n- Optimizing performance of Redux-connected form inputs\n\nAnd much more!\n\nThe course is based on Mark's original free **[\"Practical Redux\" blog tutorial series](http://blog.isquaredsoftware.com/series/practical-redux/)**, but with updated and improved content.\n\n### Redux Fundamentals Workshop\n\nRedux co-maintainer [Mark Erikson](https://twitter.com/acemarke) has put together a [**Redux Fundamentals workshop**, and slides are available here](https://blog.isquaredsoftware.com/2018/06/redux-fundamentals-workshop-slides/). They cover:\n\n- The history and purpose of Redux\n- Reducers and actions, and working with a Redux store\n- Using Redux with React\n- Using and writing Redux middleware\n- Working with AJAX calls and other side effects\n- Unit testing Redux apps\n- Real-world Redux app structure and development\n\n## Documentation\n\n- [Introduction](http://redux.js.org/introduction)\n- [Basics](http://redux.js.org/basics)\n- [Advanced](http://redux.js.org/advanced)\n- [Recipes](http://redux.js.org/recipes)\n- [FAQ](http://redux.js.org/faq)\n- [Troubleshooting](http://redux.js.org/troubleshooting)\n- [Glossary](http://redux.js.org/glossary)\n- [API Reference](http://redux.js.org/api)\n\nFor PDF, ePub, and MOBI exports for offline reading, and instructions on how to create them, please see: [paulkogel/redux-offline-docs](https://github.com/paulkogel/redux-offline-docs).\n\nFor Offline docs, please see: [devdocs](http://devdocs.io/redux/)\n\n## Examples\n\nAlmost all examples have a corresponding CodeSandbox sandbox.

Framework](https://redux.io))\n\nIt helps you write applications that behave consistently, run in different environments (client, server, and native), and are easy to test. On top of that, it provides a great developer experience, such as [live code editing combined with a time traveling debugger](https://github.com/reduxjs/redux-devtools).\n\nYou can use Redux together with [React](https://reactjs.org), or with any other view library.\nIt is tiny (2kB, including dependencies), and has a rich ecosystem of addons.\n\n![GitHub Workflow Status](https://img.shields.io/github/workflow/status/reduxjs/redux/Tests/master?style=flat-square)\n[![npm version](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/redux.svg?style=flat-square)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/redux)\n[![npm downloads](https://img.shields.io/npm/dm/redux.svg?style=flat-square)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/redux)\n[![redux channel on discord](https://img.shields.io/badge/discord-%23redux%20%40%20reactiflux-61dafb.svg?style=flat-square)](https://discord.gg/0ZcbPKXt5bZ6au5t)\n[![Changelog #187](https://img.shields.io/badge/changelog-%23187-lightgrey.svg?style=flat-square)](https://changelog.com/187)\n\n## Installation\n\n[**Redux Toolkit**](https://redux-toolkit.js.org) is our official recommended approach for writing Redux logic.

Please don't use Redux just because someone said you should - instead, please take some time to understand the potential benefits and tradeoffs of using it.\n\nHere are some suggestions on when it makes sense to use Redux:\n\n- You have reasonable amounts of data changing over time\n- You need a single source of truth for your state\n- You find that keeping all your state in a top-level component is no longer sufficient\n\nYes, these guidelines are subjective and vague, but this is for a good reason. The point at which you should integrate Redux into your application is different for every user and different for every application.\n\n> **For more thoughts on how Redux is meant to be used, please see:**<br>\n>\n> - **[When (and when not) to reach for Redux](https://changelog.com/posts/when-and-when-not-to-reach-for-redux)**\n> - **[You Might Not Need Redux](https://medium.com/@dan_abramov/you-might-not-need-redux-be46360cf367)**<br>\n> - **[The Tao of Redux, Part 1 - Implementation and Intent](https://blog.isquaredsoftware.com/2017/05/idiomatic-redux-tao-of-redux-part-1/)**<br>\n> - **[The Tao of Redux, Part 2 - Practice and Philosophy](https://blog.isquaredsoftware.com/2017/05/idiomatic-redux-tao-of-redux-part-2/)**\n> - **[Redux FAQ](https://redux.js.org/faq)**\n\n## Developer Experience\n\nDan Abramov (author of Redux) wrote Redux while working on his React Europe talk called [“Hot Reloading with Time Travel”](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsSnOQynTHs). His goal was to create a state management library with a minimal API but completely predictable behavior. Redux makes it possible to implement logging, hot reloading, time travel, universal apps, record and replay, without any buy-in from the developer.\n\n## Influences\n\nRedux evolves the ideas of [Flux](https://facebook.github.io/flux/), but avoids its complexity by taking cues from [Elm](https://github.com/evancz/elm-architecture-tutorial/).\nEven if you haven't used Flux or Elm, Redux only takes a few minutes to get started with.\n\n## Basic Example\n\nThe whole global state of your app is stored in an object tree inside a single _store_.\nThe only way to change the state tree is to create an _action_, an object describing what happened, and _dispatch_ it to the store.\nTo specify how state gets updated in response to an action, you write pure _reducer_ functions that calculate a new state based on the old state and the action.\n\n```js\nimport { createStore } from 'redux'\n\n/**\n * This is a reducer - a function that takes a current state value and an\n * action object describing \"what happened\", and returns a new state value.\n * A reducer's function signature is: (state, action) => newState\n *\n * The Redux state should contain only plain JS objects, arrays, and primitives.\n * The root state value is usually an object.  It's important that you should\n * not mutate the state object, but return a new object if the state changes.\n *\n * You can use any conditional logic you want in a reducer. In this example,\n * we use a switch statement, but it's not required.\n */\nfunction counterReducer(state = { value: 0 }, action) {\n  switch (action.type) {\n    case 'counter/incremented':\n      return { value: state.value + 1 }\n    case 'counter/decremented':\n      return { value: state.value - 1 }\n    default:\n      return state\n  }\n}\n\n// Create a Redux store holding the state of your app.\n// Its API is { subscribe, dispatch, getState }.\nlet store = createStore(counterReducer)\n\n// You can use subscribe() to update the UI in response to state changes.\n// Normally you'd use a view binding library (e.g. React Redux) rather than subscribe() directly.\n// There may be additional use cases where it's helpful to subscribe as well.\n\nstore.subscribe(() => console.log(store.getState()))\n\n// The only way to mutate the internal state is to dispatch an action.\n// The actions can be serialized, logged or stored and later replayed.\nstore.dispatch({ type: 'counter/incremented' })\n// {value: 1}\nstore.dispatch({ type: 'counter/incremented' })\n// {value: 2}\nstore.dispatch({ type: 'counter/decremented' })\n// {value: 1}\n```\n\nInstead of mutating the state directly, you specify the mutations you want to happen with plain objects called _actions_. Then you write a special function called a _reducer_ to decide how every action transforms the entire application's state.\n\nIn a typical Redux app, there is just a single store with a single root reducing function. As your app grows, you split the root reducer into smaller reducers independently operating on the different parts of the state tree. This is exactly like how there is just one root component in a React app, but it is composed out of many small components.\n\nThis architecture might seem like a lot for a counter app, but the beauty of this pattern is how well it scales to large and complex apps. It also enables very powerful developer tools, because it is possible to trace every mutation to the action that caused it. You can record user sessions and reproduce them just by replaying every action.\n\n### Redux Toolkit Example\n\nRedux Toolkit simplifies the process of writing Redux logic and setting up the store. With Redux Toolkit, that same logic looks like:\n\n```js\nimport { createSlice, configureStore } from '@reduxjs/toolkit'\n\nconst counterSlice = createSlice({\n  name: 'counter',\n  initialState: {\n    value: 0\n  },\n  reducers: {\n    incremented: state => {\n      // Redux Toolkit allows us to write \"mutating\" logic in reducers. It\n      // doesn't actually mutate the state because it uses the Immer library,\n      // which detects changes to a \"draft state\" and produces a brand new\n      // immutable state based off those changes\n      state.value += 1\n    },\n    decremented: state => {\n      state.value -= 1\n    }\n  }\n})\n\nexport const { incremented, decremented } = counterSlice.actions\n\nconst store = configureStore({\n  reducer: counterSlice.reducer\n})\n\n// Can still subscribe to the store\nstore.subscribe(() => console.log(store.getState()))\n\n// Still pass action objects to `dispatch`, but they're created for us\nstore.dispatch(incremented())\n// {value: 1}\nstore.dispatch(incremented())\n// {value: 2}\nstore.dispatch(decremented())\n// {value: 1}\n```\n\nRedux Toolkit allows us to write shorter logic that's easier to read, while still following the same Redux behavior and data flow.\n\n## Examples\n\nAlmost all examples have a corresponding CodeSandbox sandbox.

Framework](https://redux.io))\n\nIt helps you write applications that behave consistently, run in different environments (client, server, and native), and are easy to test. On top of that, it provides a great developer experience, such as [live code editing combined with a time traveling debugger](https://github.com/reduxjs/redux-devtools).\n\nYou can use Redux together with [React](https://reactjs.org), or with any other view library.\nIt is tiny (2kB, including dependencies), and has a rich ecosystem of addons.\n\n![GitHub Workflow Status](https://img.shields.io/github/workflow/status/reduxjs/redux/Tests/master?style=flat-square)\n[![npm version](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/redux.svg?style=flat-square)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/redux)\n[![npm downloads](https://img.shields.io/npm/dm/redux.svg?style=flat-square)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/redux)\n[![redux channel on discord](https://img.shields.io/badge/discord-%23redux%20%40%20reactiflux-61dafb.svg?style=flat-square)](https://discord.gg/0ZcbPKXt5bZ6au5t)\n[![Changelog #187](https://img.shields.io/badge/changelog-%23187-lightgrey.svg?style=flat-square)](https://changelog.com/187)\n\n## Installation\n\n[**Redux Toolkit**](https://redux-toolkit.js.org) is our official recommended approach for writing Redux logic.

Please don't use Redux just because someone said you should - instead, please take some time to understand the potential benefits and tradeoffs of using it.\n\nHere are some suggestions on when it makes sense to use Redux:\n\n- You have reasonable amounts of data changing over time\n- You need a single source of truth for your state\n- You find that keeping all your state in a top-level component is no longer sufficient\n\nYes, these guidelines are subjective and vague, but this is for a good reason. The point at which you should integrate Redux into your application is different for every user and different for every application.\n\n> **For more thoughts on how Redux is meant to be used, please see:**<br>\n>\n> - **[When (and when not) to reach for Redux](https://changelog.com/posts/when-and-when-not-to-reach-for-redux)**\n> - **[You Might Not Need Redux](https://medium.com/@dan_abramov/you-might-not-need-redux-be46360cf367)**<br>\n> - **[The Tao of Redux, Part 1 - Implementation and Intent](https://blog.isquaredsoftware.com/2017/05/idiomatic-redux-tao-of-redux-part-1/)**<br>\n> - **[The Tao of Redux, Part 2 - Practice and Philosophy](https://blog.isquaredsoftware.com/2017/05/idiomatic-redux-tao-of-redux-part-2/)**\n> - **[Redux FAQ](https://redux.js.org/faq)**\n\n## Developer Experience\n\nDan Abramov (author of Redux) wrote Redux while working on his React Europe talk called [“Hot Reloading with Time Travel”](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsSnOQynTHs). His goal was to create a state management library with a minimal API but completely predictable behavior. Redux makes it possible to implement logging, hot reloading, time travel, universal apps, record and replay, without any buy-in from the developer.\n\n## Influences\n\nRedux evolves the ideas of [Flux](https://facebook.github.io/flux/), but avoids its complexity by taking cues from [Elm](https://github.com/evancz/elm-architecture-tutorial/).\nEven if you haven't used Flux or Elm, Redux only takes a few minutes to get started with.\n\n## Basic Example\n\nThe whole global state of your app is stored in an object tree inside a single _store_.\nThe only way to change the state tree is to create an _action_, an object describing what happened, and _dispatch_ it to the store.\nTo specify how state gets updated in response to an action, you write pure _reducer_ functions that calculate a new state based on the old state and the action.\n\n```js\nimport { createStore } from 'redux'\n\n/**\n * This is a reducer - a function that takes a current state value and an\n * action object describing \"what happened\", and returns a new state value.\n * A reducer's function signature is: (state, action) => newState\n *\n * The Redux state should contain only plain JS objects, arrays, and primitives.\n * The root state value is usually an object.  It's important that you should\n * not mutate the state object, but return a new object if the state changes.\n *\n * You can use any conditional logic you want in a reducer. In this example,\n * we use a switch statement, but it's not required.\n */\nfunction counterReducer(state = { value: 0 }, action) {\n  switch (action.type) {\n    case 'counter/incremented':\n      return { value: state.value + 1 }\n    case 'counter/decremented':\n      return { value: state.value - 1 }\n    default:\n      return state\n  }\n}\n\n// Create a Redux store holding the state of your app.\n// Its API is { subscribe, dispatch, getState }.\nlet store = createStore(counterReducer)\n\n// You can use subscribe() to update the UI in response to state changes.\n// Normally you'd use a view binding library (e.g. React Redux) rather than subscribe() directly.\n// There may be additional use cases where it's helpful to subscribe as well.\n\nstore.subscribe(() => console.log(store.getState()))\n\n// The only way to mutate the internal state is to dispatch an action.\n// The actions can be serialized, logged or stored and later replayed.\nstore.dispatch({ type: 'counter/incremented' })\n// {value: 1}\nstore.dispatch({ type: 'counter/incremented' })\n// {value: 2}\nstore.dispatch({ type: 'counter/decremented' })\n// {value: 1}\n```\n\nInstead of mutating the state directly, you specify the mutations you want to happen with plain objects called _actions_. Then you write a special function called a _reducer_ to decide how every action transforms the entire application's state.\n\nIn a typical Redux app, there is just a single store with a single root reducing function. As your app grows, you split the root reducer into smaller reducers independently operating on the different parts of the state tree. This is exactly like how there is just one root component in a React app, but it is composed out of many small components.\n\nThis architecture might seem like a lot for a counter app, but the beauty of this pattern is how well it scales to large and complex apps. It also enables very powerful developer tools, because it is possible to trace every mutation to the action that caused it. You can record user sessions and reproduce them just by replaying every action.\n\n### Redux Toolkit Example\n\nRedux Toolkit simplifies the process of writing Redux logic and setting up the store. With Redux Toolkit, that same logic looks like:\n\n```js\nimport { createSlice, configureStore } from '@reduxjs/toolkit'\n\nconst counterSlice = createSlice({\n  name: 'counter',\n  initialState: {\n    value: 0\n  },\n  reducers: {\n    incremented: state => {\n      // Redux Toolkit allows us to write \"mutating\" logic in reducers. It\n      // doesn't actually mutate the state because it uses the Immer library,\n      // which detects changes to a \"draft state\" and produces a brand new\n      // immutable state based off those changes\n      state.value += 1\n    },\n    decremented: state => {\n      state.value -= 1\n    }\n  }\n})\n\nexport const { incremented, decremented } = counterSlice.actions\n\nconst store = configureStore({\n  reducer: counterSlice.reducer\n})\n\n// Can still subscribe to the store\nstore.subscribe(() => console.log(store.getState()))\n\n// Still pass action objects to `dispatch`, but they're created for us\nstore.dispatch(incremented())\n// {value: 1}\nstore.dispatch(incremented())\n// {value: 2}\nstore.dispatch(decremented())\n// {value: 1}\n```\n\nRedux Toolkit allows us to write shorter logic that's easier to read, while still following the same Redux behavior and data flow.\n\n## Examples\n\nAlmost all examples have a corresponding CodeSandbox sandbox.

Framework](https://redux.io))\n\nIt helps you write applications that behave consistently, run in different environments (client, server, and native), and are easy to test. On top of that, it provides a great developer experience, such as [live code editing combined with a time traveling debugger](https://github.com/reduxjs/redux-devtools).\n\nYou can use Redux together with [React](https://reactjs.org), or with any other view library.\nIt is tiny (2kB, including dependencies), and has a rich ecosystem of addons.\n\n![GitHub Workflow Status](https://img.shields.io/github/workflow/status/reduxjs/redux/Tests/master?style=flat-square)\n[![npm version](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/redux.svg?style=flat-square)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/redux)\n[![npm downloads](https://img.shields.io/npm/dm/redux.svg?style=flat-square)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/redux)\n[![redux channel on discord](https://img.shields.io/badge/discord-%23redux%20%40%20reactiflux-61dafb.svg?style=flat-square)](https://discord.gg/0ZcbPKXt5bZ6au5t)\n[![Changelog #187](https://img.shields.io/badge/changelog-%23187-lightgrey.svg?style=flat-square)](https://changelog.com/187)\n\n## Installation\n\n[**Redux Toolkit**](https://redux-toolkit.js.org) is our official recommended approach for writing Redux logic.

Reactiflux is a great place to hang out, ask questions, and learn - please come and join us there!\n\n## Before Proceeding Further\n\nRedux is a valuable tool for organizing your state, but you should also consider whether it's appropriate for your situation. Please don't use Redux just because someone said you should - instead, please take some time to understand the potential benefits and tradeoffs of using it.\n\nHere are some suggestions on when it makes sense to use Redux:\n\n- You have reasonable amounts of data changing over time\n- You need a single source of truth for your state\n- You find that keeping all your state in a top-level component is no longer sufficient\n\nYes, these guidelines are subjective and vague, but this is for a good reason. The point at which you should integrate Redux into your application is different for every user and different for every application.\n\n> **For more thoughts on how Redux is meant to be used, please see:**<br>\n>\n> - **[When (and when not) to reach for Redux](https://changelog.com/posts/when-and-when-not-to-reach-for-redux)**\n> - **[You Might Not Need Redux](https://medium.com/@dan_abramov/you-might-not-need-redux-be46360cf367)**<br>\n> - **[The Tao of Redux, Part 1 - Implementation and Intent](https://blog.isquaredsoftware.com/2017/05/idiomatic-redux-tao-of-redux-part-1/)**<br>\n> - **[The Tao of Redux, Part 2 - Practice and Philosophy](https://blog.isquaredsoftware.com/2017/05/idiomatic-redux-tao-of-redux-part-2/)**\n> - **[Redux FAQ](https://redux.js.org/faq)**\n\n## Developer Experience\n\nDan Abramov (author of Redux) wrote Redux while working on his React Europe talk called [“Hot Reloading with Time Travel”](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsSnOQynTHs). His goal was to create a state management library with a minimal API but completely predictable behavior. Redux makes it possible to implement logging, hot reloading, time travel, universal apps, record and replay, without any buy-in from the developer.\n\n## Influences\n\nRedux evolves the ideas of [Flux](https://facebook.github.io/flux/), but avoids its complexity by taking cues from [Elm](https://github.com/evancz/elm-architecture-tutorial/).\nEven if you haven't used Flux or Elm, Redux only takes a few minutes to get started with.\n\n## Basic Example\n\nThe whole global state of your app is stored in an object tree inside a single _store_.\nThe only way to change the state tree is to create an _action_, an object describing what happened, and _dispatch_ it to the store.\nTo specify how state gets updated in response to an action, you write pure _reducer_ functions that calculate a new state based on the old state and the action.\n\n```js\nimport { createStore } from 'redux'\n\n/**\n * This is a reducer - a function that takes a current state value and an\n * action object describing \"what happened\", and returns a new state value.\n * A reducer's function signature is: (state, action) => newState\n *\n * The Redux state should contain only plain JS objects, arrays, and primitives.\n * The root state value is usually an object.  It's important that you should\n * not mutate the state object, but return a new object if the state changes.\n *\n * You can use any conditional logic you want in a reducer. In this example,\n * we use a switch statement, but it's not required.\n */\nfunction counterReducer(state = { value: 0 }, action) {\n  switch (action.type) {\n    case 'counter/incremented':\n      return { value: state.value + 1 }\n    case 'counter/decremented':\n      return { value: state.value - 1 }\n    default:\n      return state\n  }\n}\n\n// Create a Redux store holding the state of your app.\n// Its API is { subscribe, dispatch, getState }.\nlet store = createStore(counterReducer)\n\n// You can use subscribe() to update the UI in response to state changes.\n// Normally you'd use a view binding library (e.g. React Redux) rather than subscribe() directly.\n// There may be additional use cases where it's helpful to subscribe as well.\n\nstore.subscribe(() => console.log(store.getState()))\n\n// The only way to mutate the internal state is to dispatch an action.\n// The actions can be serialized, logged or stored and later replayed.\nstore.dispatch({ type: 'counter/incremented' })\n// {value: 1}\nstore.dispatch({ type: 'counter/incremented' })\n// {value: 2}\nstore.dispatch({ type: 'counter/decremented' })\n// {value: 1}\n```\n\nInstead of mutating the state directly, you specify the mutations you want to happen with plain objects called _actions_. Then you write a special function called a _reducer_ to decide how every action transforms the entire application's state.\n\nIn a typical Redux app, there is just a single store with a single root reducing function. As your app grows, you split the root reducer into smaller reducers independently operating on the different parts of the state tree. This is exactly like how there is just one root component in a React app, but it is composed out of many small components.\n\nThis architecture might seem like a lot for a counter app, but the beauty of this pattern is how well it scales to large and complex apps. It also enables very powerful developer tools, because it is possible to trace every mutation to the action that caused it. You can record user sessions and reproduce them just by replaying every action.\n\n### Redux Toolkit Example\n\nRedux Toolkit simplifies the process of writing Redux logic and setting up the store. With Redux Toolkit, that same logic looks like:\n\n```js\nimport { createSlice, configureStore } from '@reduxjs/toolkit'\n\nconst counterSlice = createSlice({\n  name: 'counter',\n  initialState: {\n    value: 0\n  },\n  reducers: {\n    incremented: state => {\n      // Redux Toolkit allows us to write \"mutating\" logic in reducers. It\n      // doesn't actually mutate the state because it uses the Immer library,\n      // which detects changes to a \"draft state\" and produces a brand new\n      // immutable state based off those changes\n      state.value += 1\n    },\n    decremented: state => {\n      state.value -= 1\n    }\n  }\n})\n\nexport const { incremented, decremented } = counterSlice.actions\n\nconst store = configureStore({\n  reducer: counterSlice.reducer\n})\n\n// Can still subscribe to the store\nstore.subscribe(() => console.log(store.getState()))\n\n// Still pass action objects to `dispatch`, but they're created for us\nstore.dispatch(incremented())\n// {value: 1}\nstore.dispatch(incremented())\n// {value: 2}\nstore.dispatch(decremented())\n// {value: 1}\n```\n\nRedux Toolkit allows us to write shorter logic that's easier to read, while still following the same Redux behavior and data flow.\n\n## Examples\n\nAlmost all examples have a corresponding CodeSandbox sandbox.

Framework](https://redux.io))\n\nIt helps you write applications that behave consistently, run in different environments (client, server, and native), and are easy to test. On top of that, it provides a great developer experience, such as [live code editing combined with a time traveling debugger](https://github.com/reduxjs/redux-devtools).\n\nYou can use Redux together with [React](https://reactjs.org), or with any other view library.\nIt is tiny (2kB, including dependencies), and has a rich ecosystem of addons.\n\n![GitHub Workflow Status](https://img.shields.io/github/workflow/status/reduxjs/redux/Tests/master?style=flat-square)\n[![npm version](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/redux.svg?style=flat-square)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/redux)\n[![npm downloads](https://img.shields.io/npm/dm/redux.svg?style=flat-square)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/redux)\n[![redux channel on discord](https://img.shields.io/badge/discord-%23redux%20%40%20reactiflux-61dafb.svg?style=flat-square)](https://discord.gg/0ZcbPKXt5bZ6au5t)\n[![Changelog #187](https://img.shields.io/badge/changelog-%23187-lightgrey.svg?style=flat-square)](https://changelog.com/187)\n\n## Installation\n\n[**Redux Toolkit**](https://redux-toolkit.js.org) is our official recommended approach for writing Redux logic.

Please don't use Redux just because someone said you should - instead, please take some time to understand the potential benefits and tradeoffs of using it.\n\nHere are some suggestions on when it makes sense to use Redux:\n\n- You have reasonable amounts of data changing over time\n- You need a single source of truth for your state\n- You find that keeping all your state in a top-level component is no longer sufficient\n\nYes, these guidelines are subjective and vague, but this is for a good reason. The point at which you should integrate Redux into your application is different for every user and different for every application.\n\n> **For more thoughts on how Redux is meant to be used, please see:**<br>\n>\n> - **[When (and when not) to reach for Redux](https://changelog.com/posts/when-and-when-not-to-reach-for-redux)**\n> - **[You Might Not Need Redux](https://medium.com/@dan_abramov/you-might-not-need-redux-be46360cf367)**<br>\n> - **[The Tao of Redux, Part 1 - Implementation and Intent](https://blog.isquaredsoftware.com/2017/05/idiomatic-redux-tao-of-redux-part-1/)**<br>\n> - **[The Tao of Redux, Part 2 - Practice and Philosophy](https://blog.isquaredsoftware.com/2017/05/idiomatic-redux-tao-of-redux-part-2/)**\n> - **[Redux FAQ](https://redux.js.org/faq)**\n\n## Developer Experience\n\nDan Abramov (author of Redux) wrote Redux while working on his React Europe talk called [“Hot Reloading with Time Travel”](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsSnOQynTHs). His goal was to create a state management library with a minimal API but completely predictable behavior. Redux makes it possible to implement logging, hot reloading, time travel, universal apps, record and replay, without any buy-in from the developer.\n\n## Influences\n\nRedux evolves the ideas of [Flux](https://facebook.github.io/flux/), but avoids its complexity by taking cues from [Elm](https://github.com/evancz/elm-architecture-tutorial/).\nEven if you haven't used Flux or Elm, Redux only takes a few minutes to get started with.\n\n## Basic Example\n\nThe whole global state of your app is stored in an object tree inside a single _store_.\nThe only way to change the state tree is to create an _action_, an object describing what happened, and _dispatch_ it to the store.\nTo specify how state gets updated in response to an action, you write pure _reducer_ functions that calculate a new state based on the old state and the action.\n\n```js\nimport { createStore } from 'redux'\n\n/**\n * This is a reducer - a function that takes a current state value and an\n * action object describing \"what happened\", and returns a new state value.\n * A reducer's function signature is: (state, action) => newState\n *\n * The Redux state should contain only plain JS objects, arrays, and primitives.\n * The root state value is usually an object.  It's important that you should\n * not mutate the state object, but return a new object if the state changes.\n *\n * You can use any conditional logic you want in a reducer. In this example,\n * we use a switch statement, but it's not required.\n */\nfunction counterReducer(state = { value: 0 }, action) {\n  switch (action.type) {\n    case 'counter/incremented':\n      return { value: state.value + 1 }\n    case 'counter/decremented':\n      return { value: state.value - 1 }\n    default:\n      return state\n  }\n}\n\n// Create a Redux store holding the state of your app.\n// Its API is { subscribe, dispatch, getState }.\nlet store = createStore(counterReducer)\n\n// You can use subscribe() to update the UI in response to state changes.\n// Normally you'd use a view binding library (e.g. React Redux) rather than subscribe() directly.\n// There may be additional use cases where it's helpful to subscribe as well.\n\nstore.subscribe(() => console.log(store.getState()))\n\n// The only way to mutate the internal state is to dispatch an action.\n// The actions can be serialized, logged or stored and later replayed.\nstore.dispatch({ type: 'counter/incremented' })\n// {value: 1}\nstore.dispatch({ type: 'counter/incremented' })\n// {value: 2}\nstore.dispatch({ type: 'counter/decremented' })\n// {value: 1}\n```\n\nInstead of mutating the state directly, you specify the mutations you want to happen with plain objects called _actions_. Then you write a special function called a _reducer_ to decide how every action transforms the entire application's state.\n\nIn a typical Redux app, there is just a single store with a single root reducing function. As your app grows, you split the root reducer into smaller reducers independently operating on the different parts of the state tree. This is exactly like how there is just one root component in a React app, but it is composed out of many small components.\n\nThis architecture might seem like a lot for a counter app, but the beauty of this pattern is how well it scales to large and complex apps. It also enables very powerful developer tools, because it is possible to trace every mutation to the action that caused it. You can record user sessions and reproduce them just by replaying every action.\n\n### Redux Toolkit Example\n\nRedux Toolkit simplifies the process of writing Redux logic and setting up the store. With Redux Toolkit, that same logic looks like:\n\n```js\nimport { createSlice, configureStore } from '@reduxjs/toolkit'\n\nconst counterSlice = createSlice({\n  name: 'counter',\n  initialState: {\n    value: 0\n  },\n  reducers: {\n    incremented: state => {\n      // Redux Toolkit allows us to write \"mutating\" logic in reducers. It\n      // doesn't actually mutate the state because it uses the Immer library,\n      // which detects changes to a \"draft state\" and produces a brand new\n      // immutable state based off those changes\n      state.value += 1\n    },\n    decremented: state => {\n      state.value -= 1\n    }\n  }\n})\n\nexport const { incremented, decremented } = counterSlice.actions\n\nconst store = configureStore({\n  reducer: counterSlice.reducer\n})\n\n// Can still subscribe to the store\nstore.subscribe(() => console.log(store.getState()))\n\n// Still pass action objects to `dispatch`, but they're created for us\nstore.dispatch(incremented())\n// {value: 1}\nstore.dispatch(incremented())\n// {value: 2}\nstore.dispatch(decremented())\n// {value: 1}\n```\n\nRedux Toolkit allows us to write shorter logic that's easier to read, while still following the same Redux behavior and data flow.\n\n## Examples\n\nAlmost all examples have a corresponding CodeSandbox sandbox.

Framework](https://redux.io))\n\nIt helps you write applications that behave consistently, run in different environments (client, server, and native), and are easy to test. On top of that, it provides a great developer experience, such as [live code editing combined with a time traveling debugger](https://github.com/reduxjs/redux-devtools).\n\nYou can use Redux together with [React](https://reactjs.org), or with any other view library.\nIt is tiny (2kB, including dependencies), and has a rich ecosystem of addons.\n\n![GitHub Workflow Status](https://img.shields.io/github/workflow/status/reduxjs/redux/Tests/master?style=flat-square)\n[![npm version](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/redux.svg?style=flat-square)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/redux)\n[![npm downloads](https://img.shields.io/npm/dm/redux.svg?style=flat-square)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/redux)\n[![redux channel on discord](https://img.shields.io/badge/discord-%23redux%20%40%20reactiflux-61dafb.svg?style=flat-square)](https://discord.gg/0ZcbPKXt5bZ6au5t)\n[![Changelog #187](https://img.shields.io/badge/changelog-%23187-lightgrey.svg?style=flat-square)](https://changelog.com/187)\n\n## Installation\n\n[**Redux Toolkit**](https://redux-toolkit.js.org) is our official recommended approach for writing Redux logic.

Please don't use Redux just because someone said you should - instead, please take some time to understand the potential benefits and tradeoffs of using it.\n\nHere are some suggestions on when it makes sense to use Redux:\n\n- You have reasonable amounts of data changing over time\n- You need a single source of truth for your state\n- You find that keeping all your state in a top-level component is no longer sufficient\n\nYes, these guidelines are subjective and vague, but this is for a good reason. The point at which you should integrate Redux into your application is different for every user and different for every application.\n\n> **For more thoughts on how Redux is meant to be used, please see:**<br>\n>\n> - **[When (and when not) to reach for Redux](https://changelog.com/posts/when-and-when-not-to-reach-for-redux)**\n> - **[You Might Not Need Redux](https://medium.com/@dan_abramov/you-might-not-need-redux-be46360cf367)**<br>\n> - **[The Tao of Redux, Part 1 - Implementation and Intent](https://blog.isquaredsoftware.com/2017/05/idiomatic-redux-tao-of-redux-part-1/)**<br>\n> - **[The Tao of Redux, Part 2 - Practice and Philosophy](https://blog.isquaredsoftware.com/2017/05/idiomatic-redux-tao-of-redux-part-2/)**\n> - **[Redux FAQ](https://redux.js.org/faq)**\n\n## Developer Experience\n\nDan Abramov (author of Redux) wrote Redux while working on his React Europe talk called [“Hot Reloading with Time Travel”](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsSnOQynTHs). His goal was to create a state management library with a minimal API but completely predictable behavior. Redux makes it possible to implement logging, hot reloading, time travel, universal apps, record and replay, without any buy-in from the developer.\n\n## Influences\n\nRedux evolves the ideas of [Flux](https://facebook.github.io/flux/), but avoids its complexity by taking cues from [Elm](https://github.com/evancz/elm-architecture-tutorial/).\nEven if you haven't used Flux or Elm, Redux only takes a few minutes to get started with.\n\n## Basic Example\n\nThe whole global state of your app is stored in an object tree inside a single _store_.\nThe only way to change the state tree is to create an _action_, an object describing what happened, and _dispatch_ it to the store.\nTo specify how state gets updated in response to an action, you write pure _reducer_ functions that calculate a new state based on the old state and the action.\n\n```js\nimport { createStore } from 'redux'\n\n/**\n * This is a reducer - a function that takes a current state value and an\n * action object describing \"what happened\", and returns a new state value.\n * A reducer's function signature is: (state, action) => newState\n *\n * The Redux state should contain only plain JS objects, arrays, and primitives.\n * The root state value is usually an object.  It's important that you should\n * not mutate the state object, but return a new object if the state changes.\n *\n * You can use any conditional logic you want in a reducer. In this example,\n * we use a switch statement, but it's not required.\n */\nfunction counterReducer(state = { value: 0 }, action) {\n  switch (action.type) {\n    case 'counter/incremented':\n      return { value: state.value + 1 }\n    case 'counter/decremented':\n      return { value: state.value - 1 }\n    default:\n      return state\n  }\n}\n\n// Create a Redux store holding the state of your app.\n// Its API is { subscribe, dispatch, getState }.\nlet store = createStore(counterReducer)\n\n// You can use subscribe() to update the UI in response to state changes.\n// Normally you'd use a view binding library (e.g. React Redux) rather than subscribe() directly.\n// There may be additional use cases where it's helpful to subscribe as well.\n\nstore.subscribe(() => console.log(store.getState()))\n\n// The only way to mutate the internal state is to dispatch an action.\n// The actions can be serialized, logged or stored and later replayed.\nstore.dispatch({ type: 'counter/incremented' })\n// {value: 1}\nstore.dispatch({ type: 'counter/incremented' })\n// {value: 2}\nstore.dispatch({ type: 'counter/decremented' })\n// {value: 1}\n```\n\nInstead of mutating the state directly, you specify the mutations you want to happen with plain objects called _actions_. Then you write a special function called a _reducer_ to decide how every action transforms the entire application's state.\n\nIn a typical Redux app, there is just a single store with a single root reducing function. As your app grows, you split the root reducer into smaller reducers independently operating on the different parts of the state tree. This is exactly like how there is just one root component in a React app, but it is composed out of many small components.\n\nThis architecture might seem like a lot for a counter app, but the beauty of this pattern is how well it scales to large and complex apps. It also enables very powerful developer tools, because it is possible to trace every mutation to the action that caused it. You can record user sessions and reproduce them just by replaying every action.\n\n### Redux Toolkit Example\n\nRedux Toolkit simplifies the process of writing Redux logic and setting up the store. With Redux Toolkit, that same logic looks like:\n\n```js\nimport { createSlice, configureStore } from '@reduxjs/toolkit'\n\nconst counterSlice = createSlice({\n  name: 'counter',\n  initialState: {\n    value: 0\n  },\n  reducers: {\n    incremented: state => {\n      // Redux Toolkit allows us to write \"mutating\" logic in reducers. It\n      // doesn't actually mutate the state because it uses the Immer library,\n      // which detects changes to a \"draft state\" and produces a brand new\n      // immutable state based off those changes\n      state.value += 1\n    },\n    decremented: state => {\n      state.value -= 1\n    }\n  }\n})\n\nexport const { incremented, decremented } = counterSlice.actions\n\nconst store = configureStore({\n  reducer: counterSlice.reducer\n})\n\n// Can still subscribe to the store\nstore.subscribe(() => console.log(store.getState()))\n\n// Still pass action objects to `dispatch`, but they're created for us\nstore.dispatch(incremented())\n// {value: 1}\nstore.dispatch(incremented())\n// {value: 2}\nstore.dispatch(decremented())\n// {value: 1}\n```\n\nRedux Toolkit allows us to write shorter logic that's easier to read, while still following the same Redux behavior and data flow.\n\n## Examples\n\nAlmost all examples have a corresponding CodeSandbox sandbox.

Framework](https://redux.io))\n\nIt helps you write applications that behave consistently, run in different environments (client, server, and native), and are easy to test. On top of that, it provides a great developer experience, such as [live code editing combined with a time traveling debugger](https://github.com/reduxjs/redux-devtools).\n\nYou can use Redux together with [React](https://reactjs.org), or with any other view library.\nIt is tiny (2kB, including dependencies), and has a rich ecosystem of addons.\n\n![GitHub Workflow Status](https://img.shields.io/github/workflow/status/reduxjs/redux/Tests/master?style=flat-square)\n[![npm version](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/redux.svg?style=flat-square)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/redux)\n[![npm downloads](https://img.shields.io/npm/dm/redux.svg?style=flat-square)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/redux)\n[![redux channel on discord](https://img.shields.io/badge/discord-%23redux%20%40%20reactiflux-61dafb.svg?style=flat-square)](https://discord.gg/0ZcbPKXt5bZ6au5t)\n[![Changelog #187](https://img.shields.io/badge/changelog-%23187-lightgrey.svg?style=flat-square)](https://changelog.com/187)\n\n## Installation\n\n[**Redux Toolkit**](https://redux-toolkit.js.org) is our official recommended approach for writing Redux logic.

Please don't use Redux just because someone said you should - instead, please take some time to understand the potential benefits and tradeoffs of using it.\n\nHere are some suggestions on when it makes sense to use Redux:\n\n- You have reasonable amounts of data changing over time\n- You need a single source of truth for your state\n- You find that keeping all your state in a top-level component is no longer sufficient\n\nYes, these guidelines are subjective and vague, but this is for a good reason. The point at which you should integrate Redux into your application is different for every user and different for every application.\n\n> **For more thoughts on how Redux is meant to be used, please see:**<br>\n>\n> - **[When (and when not) to reach for Redux](https://changelog.com/posts/when-and-when-not-to-reach-for-redux)**\n> - **[You Might Not Need Redux](https://medium.com/@dan_abramov/you-might-not-need-redux-be46360cf367)**<br>\n> - **[The Tao of Redux, Part 1 - Implementation and Intent](https://blog.isquaredsoftware.com/2017/05/idiomatic-redux-tao-of-redux-part-1/)**<br>\n> - **[The Tao of Redux, Part 2 - Practice and Philosophy](https://blog.isquaredsoftware.com/2017/05/idiomatic-redux-tao-of-redux-part-2/)**\n> - **[Redux FAQ](https://redux.js.org/faq)**\n\n## Developer Experience\n\nDan Abramov (author of Redux) wrote Redux while working on his React Europe talk called [“Hot Reloading with Time Travel”](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsSnOQynTHs). His goal was to create a state management library with a minimal API but completely predictable behavior. Redux makes it possible to implement logging, hot reloading, time travel, universal apps, record and replay, without any buy-in from the developer.\n\n## Influences\n\nRedux evolves the ideas of [Flux](https://facebook.github.io/flux/), but avoids its complexity by taking cues from [Elm](https://github.com/evancz/elm-architecture-tutorial/).\nEven if you haven't used Flux or Elm, Redux only takes a few minutes to get started with.\n\n## Basic Example\n\nThe whole global state of your app is stored in an object tree inside a single _store_.\nThe only way to change the state tree is to create an _action_, an object describing what happened, and _dispatch_ it to the store.\nTo specify how state gets updated in response to an action, you write pure _reducer_ functions that calculate a new state based on the old state and the action.\n\n```js\nimport { createStore } from 'redux'\n\n/**\n * This is a reducer - a function that takes a current state value and an\n * action object describing \"what happened\", and returns a new state value.\n * A reducer's function signature is: (state, action) => newState\n *\n * The Redux state should contain only plain JS objects, arrays, and primitives.\n * The root state value is usually an object.  It's important that you should\n * not mutate the state object, but return a new object if the state changes.\n *\n * You can use any conditional logic you want in a reducer. In this example,\n * we use a switch statement, but it's not required.\n */\nfunction counterReducer(state = { value: 0 }, action) {\n  switch (action.type) {\n    case 'counter/incremented':\n      return { value: state.value + 1 }\n    case 'counter/decremented':\n      return { value: state.value - 1 }\n    default:\n      return state\n  }\n}\n\n// Create a Redux store holding the state of your app.\n// Its API is { subscribe, dispatch, getState }.\nlet store = createStore(counterReducer)\n\n// You can use subscribe() to update the UI in response to state changes.\n// Normally you'd use a view binding library (e.g. React Redux) rather than subscribe() directly.\n// There may be additional use cases where it's helpful to subscribe as well.\n\nstore.subscribe(() => console.log(store.getState()))\n\n// The only way to mutate the internal state is to dispatch an action.\n// The actions can be serialized, logged or stored and later replayed.\nstore.dispatch({ type: 'counter/incremented' })\n// {value: 1}\nstore.dispatch({ type: 'counter/incremented' })\n// {value: 2}\nstore.dispatch({ type: 'counter/decremented' })\n// {value: 1}\n```\n\nInstead of mutating the state directly, you specify the mutations you want to happen with plain objects called _actions_. Then you write a special function called a _reducer_ to decide how every action transforms the entire application's state.\n\nIn a typical Redux app, there is just a single store with a single root reducing function. As your app grows, you split the root reducer into smaller reducers independently operating on the different parts of the state tree. This is exactly like how there is just one root component in a React app, but it is composed out of many small components.\n\nThis architecture might seem like a lot for a counter app, but the beauty of this pattern is how well it scales to large and complex apps. It also enables very powerful developer tools, because it is possible to trace every mutation to the action that caused it. You can record user sessions and reproduce them just by replaying every action.\n\n### Redux Toolkit Example\n\nRedux Toolkit simplifies the process of writing Redux logic and setting up the store. With Redux Toolkit, that same logic looks like:\n\n```js\nimport { createSlice, configureStore } from '@reduxjs/toolkit'\n\nconst counterSlice = createSlice({\n  name: 'counter',\n  initialState: {\n    value: 0\n  },\n  reducers: {\n    incremented: state => {\n      // Redux Toolkit allows us to write \"mutating\" logic in reducers. It\n      // doesn't actually mutate the state because it uses the Immer library,\n      // which detects changes to a \"draft state\" and produces a brand new\n      // immutable state based off those changes\n      state.value += 1\n    },\n    decremented: state => {\n      state.value -= 1\n    }\n  }\n})\n\nexport const { incremented, decremented } = counterSlice.actions\n\nconst store = configureStore({\n  reducer: counterSlice.reducer\n})\n\n// Can still subscribe to the store\nstore.subscribe(() => console.log(store.getState()))\n\n// Still pass action objects to `dispatch`, but they're created for us\nstore.dispatch(incremented())\n// {value: 1}\nstore.dispatch(incremented())\n// {value: 2}\nstore.dispatch(decremented())\n// {value: 1}\n```\n\nRedux Toolkit allows us to write shorter logic that's easier to read, while still following the same Redux behavior and data flow.\n\n## Examples\n\nAlmost all examples have a corresponding CodeSandbox sandbox.

Framework](https://redux.io))\n\nIt helps you write applications that behave consistently, run in different environments (client, server, and native), and are easy to test. On top of that, it provides a great developer experience, such as [live code editing combined with a time traveling debugger](https://github.com/reduxjs/redux-devtools).\n\nYou can use Redux together with [React](https://reactjs.org), or with any other view library.\nIt is tiny (2kB, including dependencies), and has a rich ecosystem of addons.\n\n![GitHub Workflow Status](https://img.shields.io/github/actions/workflow/status/reduxjs/redux/test.yaml?branch=master&event=push&style=flat-square)\n[![npm version](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/redux.svg?style=flat-square)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/redux)\n[![npm downloads](https://img.shields.io/npm/dm/redux.svg?style=flat-square)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/redux)\n[![redux channel on discord](https://img.shields.io/badge/discord-%23redux%20%40%20reactiflux-61dafb.svg?style=flat-square)](https://discord.gg/0ZcbPKXt5bZ6au5t)\n[![Changelog #187](https://img.shields.io/badge/changelog-%23187-lightgrey.svg?style=flat-square)](https://changelog.com/187)\n\n## Installation\n\n[**Redux Toolkit**](https://redux-toolkit.js.org) is our official recommended approach for writing Redux logic.

Please don't use Redux just because someone said you should - instead, please take some time to understand the potential benefits and tradeoffs of using it.\n\nHere are some suggestions on when it makes sense to use Redux:\n\n- You have reasonable amounts of data changing over time\n- You need a single source of truth for your state\n- You find that keeping all your state in a top-level component is no longer sufficient\n\nYes, these guidelines are subjective and vague, but this is for a good reason. The point at which you should integrate Redux into your application is different for every user and different for every application.\n\n> **For more thoughts on how Redux is meant to be used, please see:**<br>\n>\n> - **[When (and when not) to reach for Redux](https://changelog.com/posts/when-and-when-not-to-reach-for-redux)**\n> - **[You Might Not Need Redux](https://medium.com/@dan_abramov/you-might-not-need-redux-be46360cf367)**<br>\n> - **[The Tao of Redux, Part 1 - Implementation and Intent](https://blog.isquaredsoftware.com/2017/05/idiomatic-redux-tao-of-redux-part-1/)**<br>\n> - **[The Tao of Redux, Part 2 - Practice and Philosophy](https://blog.isquaredsoftware.com/2017/05/idiomatic-redux-tao-of-redux-part-2/)**\n> - **[Redux FAQ](https://redux.js.org/faq)**\n\n## Developer Experience\n\nDan Abramov (author of Redux) wrote Redux while working on his React Europe talk called [“Hot Reloading with Time Travel”](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsSnOQynTHs). His goal was to create a state management library with a minimal API but completely predictable behavior. Redux makes it possible to implement logging, hot reloading, time travel, universal apps, record and replay, without any buy-in from the developer.\n\n## Influences\n\nRedux evolves the ideas of [Flux](https://facebook.github.io/flux/), but avoids its complexity by taking cues from [Elm](https://github.com/evancz/elm-architecture-tutorial/).\nEven if you haven't used Flux or Elm, Redux only takes a few minutes to get started with.\n\n## Basic Example\n\nThe whole global state of your app is stored in an object tree inside a single _store_.\nThe only way to change the state tree is to create an _action_, an object describing what happened, and _dispatch_ it to the store.\nTo specify how state gets updated in response to an action, you write pure _reducer_ functions that calculate a new state based on the old state and the action.\n\n```js\nimport { createStore } from 'redux'\n\n/**\n * This is a reducer - a function that takes a current state value and an\n * action object describing \"what happened\", and returns a new state value.\n * A reducer's function signature is: (state, action) => newState\n *\n * The Redux state should contain only plain JS objects, arrays, and primitives.\n * The root state value is usually an object.  It's important that you should\n * not mutate the state object, but return a new object if the state changes.\n *\n * You can use any conditional logic you want in a reducer. In this example,\n * we use a switch statement, but it's not required.\n */\nfunction counterReducer(state = { value: 0 }, action) {\n  switch (action.type) {\n    case 'counter/incremented':\n      return { value: state.value + 1 }\n    case 'counter/decremented':\n      return { value: state.value - 1 }\n    default:\n      return state\n  }\n}\n\n// Create a Redux store holding the state of your app.\n// Its API is { subscribe, dispatch, getState }.\nlet store = createStore(counterReducer)\n\n// You can use subscribe() to update the UI in response to state changes.\n// Normally you'd use a view binding library (e.g. React Redux) rather than subscribe() directly.\n// There may be additional use cases where it's helpful to subscribe as well.\n\nstore.subscribe(() => console.log(store.getState()))\n\n// The only way to mutate the internal state is to dispatch an action.\n// The actions can be serialized, logged or stored and later replayed.\nstore.dispatch({ type: 'counter/incremented' })\n// {value: 1}\nstore.dispatch({ type: 'counter/incremented' })\n// {value: 2}\nstore.dispatch({ type: 'counter/decremented' })\n// {value: 1}\n```\n\nInstead of mutating the state directly, you specify the mutations you want to happen with plain objects called _actions_. Then you write a special function called a _reducer_ to decide how every action transforms the entire application's state.\n\nIn a typical Redux app, there is just a single store with a single root reducing function. As your app grows, you split the root reducer into smaller reducers independently operating on the different parts of the state tree. This is exactly like how there is just one root component in a React app, but it is composed out of many small components.\n\nThis architecture might seem like a lot for a counter app, but the beauty of this pattern is how well it scales to large and complex apps. It also enables very powerful developer tools, because it is possible to trace every mutation to the action that caused it. You can record user sessions and reproduce them just by replaying every action.\n\n### Redux Toolkit Example\n\nRedux Toolkit simplifies the process of writing Redux logic and setting up the store. With Redux Toolkit, that same logic looks like:\n\n```js\nimport { createSlice, configureStore } from '@reduxjs/toolkit'\n\nconst counterSlice = createSlice({\n  name: 'counter',\n  initialState: {\n    value: 0\n  },\n  reducers: {\n    incremented: state => {\n      // Redux Toolkit allows us to write \"mutating\" logic in reducers. It\n      // doesn't actually mutate the state because it uses the Immer library,\n      // which detects changes to a \"draft state\" and produces a brand new\n      // immutable state based off those changes\n      state.value += 1\n    },\n    decremented: state => {\n      state.value -= 1\n    }\n  }\n})\n\nexport const { incremented, decremented } = counterSlice.actions\n\nconst store = configureStore({\n  reducer: counterSlice.reducer\n})\n\n// Can still subscribe to the store\nstore.subscribe(() => console.log(store.getState()))\n\n// Still pass action objects to `dispatch`, but they're created for us\nstore.dispatch(incremented())\n// {value: 1}\nstore.dispatch(incremented())\n// {value: 2}\nstore.dispatch(decremented())\n// {value: 1}\n```\n\nRedux Toolkit allows us to write shorter logic that's easier to read, while still following the same Redux behavior and data flow.\n\n## Examples\n\nAlmost all examples have a corresponding CodeSandbox sandbox.

Framework](https://redux.io))\n\nIt helps you write applications that behave consistently, run in different environments (client, server, and native), and are easy to test. On top of that, it provides a great developer experience, such as [live code editing combined with a time traveling debugger](https://github.com/reduxjs/redux-devtools).\n\nYou can use Redux together with [React](https://reactjs.org), or with any other view library.\nIt is tiny (2kB, including dependencies), and has a rich ecosystem of addons.\n\n![GitHub Workflow Status](https://img.shields.io/github/actions/workflow/status/reduxjs/redux/test.yaml?branch=master&event=push&style=flat-square)\n[![npm version](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/redux.svg?style=flat-square)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/redux)\n[![npm downloads](https://img.shields.io/npm/dm/redux.svg?style=flat-square)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/redux)\n[![redux channel on discord](https://img.shields.io/badge/discord-%23redux%20%40%20reactiflux-61dafb.svg?style=flat-square)](https://discord.gg/0ZcbPKXt5bZ6au5t)\n[![Changelog #187](https://img.shields.io/badge/changelog-%23187-lightgrey.svg?style=flat-square)](https://changelog.com/187)\n\n## Installation\n\n[**Redux Toolkit**](https://redux-toolkit.js.org) is our official recommended approach for writing Redux logic.

Please don't use Redux just because someone said you should - instead, please take some time to understand the potential benefits and tradeoffs of using it.\n\nHere are some suggestions on when it makes sense to use Redux:\n\n- You have reasonable amounts of data changing over time\n- You need a single source of truth for your state\n- You find that keeping all your state in a top-level component is no longer sufficient\n\nYes, these guidelines are subjective and vague, but this is for a good reason. The point at which you should integrate Redux into your application is different for every user and different for every application.\n\n> **For more thoughts on how Redux is meant to be used, please see:**<br>\n>\n> - **[When (and when not) to reach for Redux](https://changelog.com/posts/when-and-when-not-to-reach-for-redux)**\n> - **[You Might Not Need Redux](https://medium.com/@dan_abramov/you-might-not-need-redux-be46360cf367)**<br>\n> - **[The Tao of Redux, Part 1 - Implementation and Intent](https://blog.isquaredsoftware.com/2017/05/idiomatic-redux-tao-of-redux-part-1/)**<br>\n> - **[The Tao of Redux, Part 2 - Practice and Philosophy](https://blog.isquaredsoftware.com/2017/05/idiomatic-redux-tao-of-redux-part-2/)**\n> - **[Redux FAQ](https://redux.js.org/faq)**\n\n## Developer Experience\n\nDan Abramov (author of Redux) wrote Redux while working on his React Europe talk called [“Hot Reloading with Time Travel”](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsSnOQynTHs). His goal was to create a state management library with a minimal API but completely predictable behavior. Redux makes it possible to implement logging, hot reloading, time travel, universal apps, record and replay, without any buy-in from the developer.\n\n## Influences\n\nRedux evolves the ideas of [Flux](https://facebook.github.io/flux/), but avoids its complexity by taking cues from [Elm](https://github.com/evancz/elm-architecture-tutorial/).\nEven if you haven't used Flux or Elm, Redux only takes a few minutes to get started with.\n\n## Basic Example\n\nThe whole global state of your app is stored in an object tree inside a single _store_.\nThe only way to change the state tree is to create an _action_, an object describing what happened, and _dispatch_ it to the store.\nTo specify how state gets updated in response to an action, you write pure _reducer_ functions that calculate a new state based on the old state and the action.\n\n```js\nimport { createStore } from 'redux'\n\n/**\n * This is a reducer - a function that takes a current state value and an\n * action object describing \"what happened\", and returns a new state value.\n * A reducer's function signature is: (state, action) => newState\n *\n * The Redux state should contain only plain JS objects, arrays, and primitives.\n * The root state value is usually an object.  It's important that you should\n * not mutate the state object, but return a new object if the state changes.\n *\n * You can use any conditional logic you want in a reducer. In this example,\n * we use a switch statement, but it's not required.\n */\nfunction counterReducer(state = { value: 0 }, action) {\n  switch (action.type) {\n    case 'counter/incremented':\n      return { value: state.value + 1 }\n    case 'counter/decremented':\n      return { value: state.value - 1 }\n    default:\n      return state\n  }\n}\n\n// Create a Redux store holding the state of your app.\n// Its API is { subscribe, dispatch, getState }.\nlet store = createStore(counterReducer)\n\n// You can use subscribe() to update the UI in response to state changes.\n// Normally you'd use a view binding library (e.g. React Redux) rather than subscribe() directly.\n// There may be additional use cases where it's helpful to subscribe as well.\n\nstore.subscribe(() => console.log(store.getState()))\n\n// The only way to mutate the internal state is to dispatch an action.\n// The actions can be serialized, logged or stored and later replayed.\nstore.dispatch({ type: 'counter/incremented' })\n// {value: 1}\nstore.dispatch({ type: 'counter/incremented' })\n// {value: 2}\nstore.dispatch({ type: 'counter/decremented' })\n// {value: 1}\n```\n\nInstead of mutating the state directly, you specify the mutations you want to happen with plain objects called _actions_. Then you write a special function called a _reducer_ to decide how every action transforms the entire application's state.\n\nIn a typical Redux app, there is just a single store with a single root reducing function. As your app grows, you split the root reducer into smaller reducers independently operating on the different parts of the state tree. This is exactly like how there is just one root component in a React app, but it is composed out of many small components.\n\nThis architecture might seem like a lot for a counter app, but the beauty of this pattern is how well it scales to large and complex apps. It also enables very powerful developer tools, because it is possible to trace every mutation to the action that caused it. You can record user sessions and reproduce them just by replaying every action.\n\n### Redux Toolkit Example\n\nRedux Toolkit simplifies the process of writing Redux logic and setting up the store.

Framework](https://redux.io))\n\nIt helps you write applications that behave consistently, run in different environments (client, server, and native), and are easy to test. On top of that, it provides a great developer experience, such as [live code editing combined with a time traveling debugger](https://github.com/reduxjs/redux-devtools).\n\nYou can use Redux together with [React](https://reactjs.org), or with any other view library.\nIt is tiny (2kB, including dependencies), and has a rich ecosystem of addons.\n\n![GitHub Workflow Status](https://img.shields.io/github/actions/workflow/status/reduxjs/redux/test.yaml?branch=master&event=push&style=flat-square)\n[![npm version](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/redux.svg?style=flat-square)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/redux)\n[![npm downloads](https://img.shields.io/npm/dm/redux.svg?style=flat-square)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/redux)\n[![redux channel on discord](https://img.shields.io/badge/discord-%23redux%20%40%20reactiflux-61dafb.svg?style=flat-square)](https://discord.gg/0ZcbPKXt5bZ6au5t)\n[![Changelog #187](https://img.shields.io/badge/changelog-%23187-lightgrey.svg?style=flat-square)](https://changelog.com/187)\n\n## Installation\n\n[**Redux Toolkit**](https://redux-toolkit.js.org) is our official recommended approach for writing Redux logic.

Please don't use Redux just because someone said you should - instead, please take some time to understand the potential benefits and tradeoffs of using it.\n\nHere are some suggestions on when it makes sense to use Redux:\n\n- You have reasonable amounts of data changing over time\n- You need a single source of truth for your state\n- You find that keeping all your state in a top-level component is no longer sufficient\n\nYes, these guidelines are subjective and vague, but this is for a good reason. The point at which you should integrate Redux into your application is different for every user and different for every application.\n\n> **For more thoughts on how Redux is meant to be used, please see:**<br>\n>\n> - **[When (and when not) to reach for Redux](https://changelog.com/posts/when-and-when-not-to-reach-for-redux)**\n> - **[You Might Not Need Redux](https://medium.com/@dan_abramov/you-might-not-need-redux-be46360cf367)**<br>\n> - **[The Tao of Redux, Part 1 - Implementation and Intent](https://blog.isquaredsoftware.com/2017/05/idiomatic-redux-tao-of-redux-part-1/)**<br>\n> - **[The Tao of Redux, Part 2 - Practice and Philosophy](https://blog.isquaredsoftware.com/2017/05/idiomatic-redux-tao-of-redux-part-2/)**\n> - **[Redux FAQ](https://redux.js.org/faq)**\n\n## Developer Experience\n\nDan Abramov (author of Redux) wrote Redux while working on his React Europe talk called [“Hot Reloading with Time Travel”](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsSnOQynTHs). His goal was to create a state management library with a minimal API but completely predictable behavior. Redux makes it possible to implement logging, hot reloading, time travel, universal apps, record and replay, without any buy-in from the developer.\n\n## Influences\n\nRedux evolves the ideas of [Flux](https://facebook.github.io/flux/), but avoids its complexity by taking cues from [Elm](https://github.com/evancz/elm-architecture-tutorial/).\nEven if you haven't used Flux or Elm, Redux only takes a few minutes to get started with.\n\n## Basic Example\n\nThe whole global state of your app is stored in an object tree inside a single _store_.\nThe only way to change the state tree is to create an _action_, an object describing what happened, and _dispatch_ it to the store.\nTo specify how state gets updated in response to an action, you write pure _reducer_ functions that calculate a new state based on the old state and the action.\n\n```js\nimport { createStore } from 'redux'\n\n/**\n * This is a reducer - a function that takes a current state value and an\n * action object describing \"what happened\", and returns a new state value.\n * A reducer's function signature is: (state, action) => newState\n *\n * The Redux state should contain only plain JS objects, arrays, and primitives.\n * The root state value is usually an object.  It's important that you should\n * not mutate the state object, but return a new object if the state changes.\n *\n * You can use any conditional logic you want in a reducer. In this example,\n * we use a switch statement, but it's not required.\n */\nfunction counterReducer(state = { value: 0 }, action) {\n  switch (action.type) {\n    case 'counter/incremented':\n      return { value: state.value + 1 }\n    case 'counter/decremented':\n      return { value: state.value - 1 }\n    default:\n      return state\n  }\n}\n\n// Create a Redux store holding the state of your app.\n// Its API is { subscribe, dispatch, getState }.\nlet store = createStore(counterReducer)\n\n// You can use subscribe() to update the UI in response to state changes.\n// Normally you'd use a view binding library (e.g. React Redux) rather than subscribe() directly.\n// There may be additional use cases where it's helpful to subscribe as well.\n\nstore.subscribe(() => console.log(store.getState()))\n\n// The only way to mutate the internal state is to dispatch an action.\n// The actions can be serialized, logged or stored and later replayed.\nstore.dispatch({ type: 'counter/incremented' })\n// {value: 1}\nstore.dispatch({ type: 'counter/incremented' })\n// {value: 2}\nstore.dispatch({ type: 'counter/decremented' })\n// {value: 1}\n```\n\nInstead of mutating the state directly, you specify the mutations you want to happen with plain objects called _actions_. Then you write a special function called a _reducer_ to decide how every action transforms the entire application's state.\n\nIn a typical Redux app, there is just a single store with a single root reducing function. As your app grows, you split the root reducer into smaller reducers independently operating on the different parts of the state tree. This is exactly like how there is just one root component in a React app, but it is composed out of many small components.\n\nThis architecture might seem like a lot for a counter app, but the beauty of this pattern is how well it scales to large and complex apps. It also enables very powerful developer tools, because it is possible to trace every mutation to the action that caused it. You can record user sessions and reproduce them just by replaying every action.\n\n### Redux Toolkit Example\n\nRedux Toolkit simplifies the process of writing Redux logic and setting up the store. With Redux Toolkit, that same logic looks like:\n\n```js\nimport { createSlice, configureStore } from '@reduxjs/toolkit'\n\nconst counterSlice = createSlice({\n  name: 'counter',\n  initialState: {\n    value: 0\n  },\n  reducers: {\n    incremented: state => {\n      // Redux Toolkit allows us to write \"mutating\" logic in reducers. It\n      // doesn't actually mutate the state because it uses the Immer library,\n      // which detects changes to a \"draft state\" and produces a brand new\n      // immutable state based off those changes\n      state.value += 1\n    },\n    decremented: state => {\n      state.value -= 1\n    }\n  }\n})\n\nexport const { incremented, decremented } = counterSlice.actions\n\nconst store = configureStore({\n  reducer: counterSlice.reducer\n})\n\n// Can still subscribe to the store\nstore.subscribe(() => console.log(store.getState()))\n\n// Still pass action objects to `dispatch`, but they're created for us\nstore.dispatch(incremented())\n// {value: 1}\nstore.dispatch(incremented())\n// {value: 2}\nstore.dispatch(decremented())\n// {value: 1}\n```\n\nRedux Toolkit allows us to write shorter logic that's easier to read, while still following the same Redux behavior and data flow.\n\n## Examples\n\nAlmost all examples have a corresponding CodeSandbox sandbox.

Framework](https://redux.io))\n\nIt helps you write applications that behave consistently, run in different environments (client, server, and native), and are easy to test. On top of that, it provides a great developer experience, such as [live code editing combined with a time traveling debugger](https://github.com/reduxjs/redux-devtools).\n\nYou can use Redux together with [React](https://reactjs.org), or with any other view library.\nIt is tiny (2kB, including dependencies), and has a rich ecosystem of addons.\n\n![GitHub Workflow Status](https://img.shields.io/github/actions/workflow/status/reduxjs/redux/test.yaml?branch=master&event=push&style=flat-square)\n[![npm version](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/redux.svg?style=flat-square)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/redux)\n[![npm downloads](https://img.shields.io/npm/dm/redux.svg?style=flat-square)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/redux)\n[![redux channel on discord](https://img.shields.io/badge/discord-%23redux%20%40%20reactiflux-61dafb.svg?style=flat-square)](https://discord.gg/0ZcbPKXt5bZ6au5t)\n[![Changelog #187](https://img.shields.io/badge/changelog-%23187-lightgrey.svg?style=flat-square)](https://changelog.com/187)\n\n## Installation\n\n[**Redux Toolkit**](https://redux-toolkit.js.org) is our official recommended approach for writing Redux logic.

Please don't use Redux just because someone said you should - instead, please take some time to understand the potential benefits and tradeoffs of using it.\n\nHere are some suggestions on when it makes sense to use Redux:\n\n- You have reasonable amounts of data changing over time\n- You need a single source of truth for your state\n- You find that keeping all your state in a top-level component is no longer sufficient\n\nYes, these guidelines are subjective and vague, but this is for a good reason. The point at which you should integrate Redux into your application is different for every user and different for every application.\n\n> **For more thoughts on how Redux is meant to be used, please see:**<br>\n>\n> - **[When (and when not) to reach for Redux](https://changelog.com/posts/when-and-when-not-to-reach-for-redux)**\n> - **[You Might Not Need Redux](https://medium.com/@dan_abramov/you-might-not-need-redux-be46360cf367)**<br>\n> - **[The Tao of Redux, Part 1 - Implementation and Intent](https://blog.isquaredsoftware.com/2017/05/idiomatic-redux-tao-of-redux-part-1/)**<br>\n> - **[The Tao of Redux, Part 2 - Practice and Philosophy](https://blog.isquaredsoftware.com/2017/05/idiomatic-redux-tao-of-redux-part-2/)**\n> - **[Redux FAQ](https://redux.js.org/faq)**\n\n## Developer Experience\n\nDan Abramov (author of Redux) wrote Redux while working on his React Europe talk called [“Hot Reloading with Time Travel”](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsSnOQynTHs). His goal was to create a state management library with a minimal API but completely predictable behavior. Redux makes it possible to implement logging, hot reloading, time travel, universal apps, record and replay, without any buy-in from the developer.\n\n## Influences\n\nRedux evolves the ideas of [Flux](https://facebook.github.io/flux/), but avoids its complexity by taking cues from [Elm](https://github.com/evancz/elm-architecture-tutorial/).\nEven if you haven't used Flux or Elm, Redux only takes a few minutes to get started with.\n\n## Basic Example\n\nThe whole global state of your app is stored in an object tree inside a single _store_.\nThe only way to change the state tree is to create an _action_, an object describing what happened, and _dispatch_ it to the store.\nTo specify how state gets updated in response to an action, you write pure _reducer_ functions that calculate a new state based on the old state and the action.\n\n```js\nimport { createStore } from 'redux'\n\n/**\n * This is a reducer - a function that takes a current state value and an\n * action object describing \"what happened\", and returns a new state value.\n * A reducer's function signature is: (state, action) => newState\n *\n * The Redux state should contain only plain JS objects, arrays, and primitives.\n * The root state value is usually an object.  It's important that you should\n * not mutate the state object, but return a new object if the state changes.\n *\n * You can use any conditional logic you want in a reducer. In this example,\n * we use a switch statement, but it's not required.\n */\nfunction counterReducer(state = { value: 0 }, action) {\n  switch (action.type) {\n    case 'counter/incremented':\n      return { value: state.value + 1 }\n    case 'counter/decremented':\n      return { value: state.value - 1 }\n    default:\n      return state\n  }\n}\n\n// Create a Redux store holding the state of your app.\n// Its API is { subscribe, dispatch, getState }.\nlet store = createStore(counterReducer)\n\n// You can use subscribe() to update the UI in response to state changes.\n// Normally you'd use a view binding library (e.g. React Redux) rather than subscribe() directly.\n// There may be additional use cases where it's helpful to subscribe as well.\n\nstore.subscribe(() => console.log(store.getState()))\n\n// The only way to mutate the internal state is to dispatch an action.\n// The actions can be serialized, logged or stored and later replayed.\nstore.dispatch({ type: 'counter/incremented' })\n// {value: 1}\nstore.dispatch({ type: 'counter/incremented' })\n// {value: 2}\nstore.dispatch({ type: 'counter/decremented' })\n// {value: 1}\n```\n\nInstead of mutating the state directly, you specify the mutations you want to happen with plain objects called _actions_. Then you write a special function called a _reducer_ to decide how every action transforms the entire application's state.\n\nIn a typical Redux app, there is just a single store with a single root reducing function. As your app grows, you split the root reducer into smaller reducers independently operating on the different parts of the state tree. This is exactly like how there is just one root component in a React app, but it is composed out of many small components.\n\nThis architecture might seem like a lot for a counter app, but the beauty of this pattern is how well it scales to large and complex apps. It also enables very powerful developer tools, because it is possible to trace every mutation to the action that caused it. You can record user sessions and reproduce them just by replaying every action.\n\n### Redux Toolkit Example\n\nRedux Toolkit simplifies the process of writing Redux logic and setting up the store. With Redux Toolkit, that same logic looks like:\n\n```js\nimport { createSlice, configureStore } from '@reduxjs/toolkit'\n\nconst counterSlice = createSlice({\n  name: 'counter',\n  initialState: {\n    value: 0\n  },\n  reducers: {\n    incremented: state => {\n      // Redux Toolkit allows us to write \"mutating\" logic in reducers. It\n      // doesn't actually mutate the state because it uses the Immer library,\n      // which detects changes to a \"draft state\" and produces a brand new\n      // immutable state based off those changes\n      state.value += 1\n    },\n    decremented: state => {\n      state.value -= 1\n    }\n  }\n})\n\nexport const { incremented, decremented } = counterSlice.actions\n\nconst store = configureStore({\n  reducer: counterSlice.reducer\n})\n\n// Can still subscribe to the store\nstore.subscribe(() => console.log(store.getState()))\n\n// Still pass action objects to `dispatch`, but they're created for us\nstore.dispatch(incremented())\n// {value: 1}\nstore.dispatch(incremented())\n// {value: 2}\nstore.dispatch(decremented())\n// {value: 1}\n```\n\nRedux Toolkit allows us to write shorter logic that's easier to read, while still following the same Redux behavior and data flow.\n\n## Examples\n\nAlmost all examples have a corresponding CodeSandbox sandbox.

Framework](https://redux.io))\n\nIt helps you write applications that behave consistently, run in different environments (client, server, and native), and are easy to test. On top of that, it provides a great developer experience, such as [live code editing combined with a time traveling debugger](https://github.com/reduxjs/redux-devtools).\n\nYou can use Redux together with [React](https://reactjs.org), or with any other view library.\nIt is tiny (2kB, including dependencies), and has a rich ecosystem of addons.\n\n![GitHub Workflow Status](https://img.shields.io/github/actions/workflow/status/reduxjs/redux/test.yaml?branch=master&event=push&style=flat-square)\n[![npm version](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/redux.svg?style=flat-square)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/redux)\n[![npm downloads](https://img.shields.io/npm/dm/redux.svg?style=flat-square)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/redux)\n[![redux channel on discord](https://img.shields.io/badge/discord-%23redux%20%40%20reactiflux-61dafb.svg?style=flat-square)](https://discord.gg/0ZcbPKXt5bZ6au5t)\n[![Changelog #187](https://img.shields.io/badge/changelog-%23187-lightgrey.svg?style=flat-square)](https://changelog.com/187)\n\n## Installation\n\n[**Redux Toolkit**](https://redux-toolkit.js.org) is our official recommended approach for writing Redux logic.

Please don't use Redux just because someone said you should - instead, please take some time to understand the potential benefits and tradeoffs of using it.\n\nHere are some suggestions on when it makes sense to use Redux:\n\n- You have reasonable amounts of data changing over time\n- You need a single source of truth for your state\n- You find that keeping all your state in a top-level component is no longer sufficient\n\nYes, these guidelines are subjective and vague, but this is for a good reason. The point at which you should integrate Redux into your application is different for every user and different for every application.\n\n> **For more thoughts on how Redux is meant to be used, please see:**<br>\n>\n> - **[When (and when not) to reach for Redux](https://changelog.com/posts/when-and-when-not-to-reach-for-redux)**\n> - **[You Might Not Need Redux](https://medium.com/@dan_abramov/you-might-not-need-redux-be46360cf367)**<br>\n> - **[The Tao of Redux, Part 1 - Implementation and Intent](https://blog.isquaredsoftware.com/2017/05/idiomatic-redux-tao-of-redux-part-1/)**<br>\n> - **[The Tao of Redux, Part 2 - Practice and Philosophy](https://blog.isquaredsoftware.com/2017/05/idiomatic-redux-tao-of-redux-part-2/)**\n> - **[Redux FAQ](https://redux.js.org/faq)**\n\n## Developer Experience\n\nDan Abramov (author of Redux) wrote Redux while working on his React Europe talk called [“Hot Reloading with Time Travel”](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsSnOQynTHs). His goal was to create a state management library with a minimal API but completely predictable behavior. Redux makes it possible to implement logging, hot reloading, time travel, universal apps, record and replay, without any buy-in from the developer.\n\n## Influences\n\nRedux evolves the ideas of [Flux](https://facebook.github.io/flux/), but avoids its complexity by taking cues from [Elm](https://github.com/evancz/elm-architecture-tutorial/).\nEven if you haven't used Flux or Elm, Redux only takes a few minutes to get started with.\n\n## Basic Example\n\nThe whole global state of your app is stored in an object tree inside a single _store_.\nThe only way to change the state tree is to create an _action_, an object describing what happened, and _dispatch_ it to the store.\nTo specify how state gets updated in response to an action, you write pure _reducer_ functions that calculate a new state based on the old state and the action.\n\n```js\nimport { createStore } from 'redux'\n\n/**\n * This is a reducer - a function that takes a current state value and an\n * action object describing \"what happened\", and returns a new state value.\n * A reducer's function signature is: (state, action) => newState\n *\n * The Redux state should contain only plain JS objects, arrays, and primitives.\n * The root state value is usually an object.  It's important that you should\n * not mutate the state object, but return a new object if the state changes.\n *\n * You can use any conditional logic you want in a reducer. In this example,\n * we use a switch statement, but it's not required.\n */\nfunction counterReducer(state = { value: 0 }, action) {\n  switch (action.type) {\n    case 'counter/incremented':\n      return { value: state.value + 1 }\n    case 'counter/decremented':\n      return { value: state.value - 1 }\n    default:\n      return state\n  }\n}\n\n// Create a Redux store holding the state of your app.\n// Its API is { subscribe, dispatch, getState }.\nlet store = createStore(counterReducer)\n\n// You can use subscribe() to update the UI in response to state changes.\n// Normally you'd use a view binding library (e.g. React Redux) rather than subscribe() directly.\n// There may be additional use cases where it's helpful to subscribe as well.\n\nstore.subscribe(() => console.log(store.getState()))\n\n// The only way to mutate the internal state is to dispatch an action.\n// The actions can be serialized, logged or stored and later replayed.\nstore.dispatch({ type: 'counter/incremented' })\n// {value: 1}\nstore.dispatch({ type: 'counter/incremented' })\n// {value: 2}\nstore.dispatch({ type: 'counter/decremented' })\n// {value: 1}\n```\n\nInstead of mutating the state directly, you specify the mutations you want to happen with plain objects called _actions_. Then you write a special function called a _reducer_ to decide how every action transforms the entire application's state.\n\nIn a typical Redux app, there is just a single store with a single root reducing function. As your app grows, you split the root reducer into smaller reducers independently operating on the different parts of the state tree. This is exactly like how there is just one root component in a React app, but it is composed out of many small components.\n\nThis architecture might seem like a lot for a counter app, but the beauty of this pattern is how well it scales to large and complex apps. It also enables very powerful developer tools, because it is possible to trace every mutation to the action that caused it. You can record user sessions and reproduce them just by replaying every action.\n\n### Redux Toolkit Example\n\nRedux Toolkit simplifies the process of writing Redux logic and setting up the store. With Redux Toolkit, that same logic looks like:\n\n```js\nimport { createSlice, configureStore } from '@reduxjs/toolkit'\n\nconst counterSlice = createSlice({\n  name: 'counter',\n  initialState: {\n    value: 0\n  },\n  reducers: {\n    incremented: state => {\n      // Redux Toolkit allows us to write \"mutating\" logic in reducers. It\n      // doesn't actually mutate the state because it uses the Immer library,\n      // which detects changes to a \"draft state\" and produces a brand new\n      // immutable state based off those changes\n      state.value += 1\n    },\n    decremented: state => {\n      state.value -= 1\n    }\n  }\n})\n\nexport const { incremented, decremented } = counterSlice.actions\n\nconst store = configureStore({\n  reducer: counterSlice.reducer\n})\n\n// Can still subscribe to the store\nstore.subscribe(() => console.log(store.getState()))\n\n// Still pass action objects to `dispatch`, but they're created for us\nstore.dispatch(incremented())\n// {value: 1}\nstore.dispatch(incremented())\n// {value: 2}\nstore.dispatch(decremented())\n// {value: 1}\n```\n\nRedux Toolkit allows us to write shorter logic that's easier to read, while still following the same Redux behavior and data flow.\n\n## Examples\n\nAlmost all examples have a corresponding CodeSandbox sandbox.

easy to test. On top of that, it provides a great developer experience, such as [live code editing combined with a time traveling debugger](https://github.com/reduxjs/redux-devtools).\n\nYou can use Redux together with [React](https://react.dev), or with any other view library. The Redux core is tiny (2kB, including dependencies), and has a rich ecosystem of addons.\n\n[**Redux Toolkit**](https://redux-toolkit.js.org) is our official recommended approach for writing Redux logic. It wraps around the Redux core, and contains packages and functions that we think are essential for building a Redux app. Redux Toolkit builds in our suggested best practices, simplifies most Redux tasks, prevents common mistakes, and makes it easier to write Redux applications.\n\n![GitHub Workflow Status](https://img.shields.io/github/actions/workflow/status/reduxjs/redux/test.yaml?branch=master&event=push&style=flat-square)\n[![npm version](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/redux.svg?style=flat-square)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/redux)\n[![npm downloads](https://img.shields.io/npm/dm/redux.svg?style=flat-square)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/redux)\n[![redux channel on discord](https://img.shields.io/badge/discord-%23redux%20%40%20reactiflux-61dafb.svg?style=flat-square)](https://discord.gg/0ZcbPKXt5bZ6au5t)\n\n## Installation\n\n### Create a React Redux App\n\nThe recommended way to start new apps with React and Redux Toolkit is by using [our official Redux Toolkit + TS template for Vite](https://github.com/reduxjs/redux-templates), or by creating a new Next.js project using [Next's `with-redux` template](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/examples/with-redux).\n\nBoth of these already have Redux Toolkit and React-Redux configured appropriately for that build tool, and come with a small example app that demonstrates how to use several of Redux Toolkit's features.\n\n```bash\n# Vite with our Redux+TS template\n# (using the `degit` tool to clone and extract the template)\nnpx degit reduxjs/redux-templates/packages/vite-template-redux my-app\n\n# Next.js using the `with-redux` template\nnpx create-next-app --example with-redux my-app\n```\n\nWe do not currently have official React Native templates, but recommend these templates for standard React Native and for Expo:\n\n- https://github.com/rahsheen/react-native-template-redux-typescript\n- https://github.com/rahsheen/expo-template-redux-typescript\n\n```\nnpm install @reduxjs/toolkit react-redux\n```\n\nFor the Redux core library by itself:\n\n```\nnpm install redux\n```\n\nFor more details, see [the Installation docs page](https://redux.js.org/introduction/installation).\n\n## Documentation\n\nThe Redux core docs are located at **https://redux.js.org**, and include the full Redux tutorials, as well usage guides on general Redux patterns:\n\n- [Introduction](https://redux.js.org/introduction/getting-started)\n- [Tutorials](https://redux.js.org/tutorials/index)\n- [Usage Guides](https://redux.js.org/usage/index)\n- [FAQ](https://redux.js.org/faq)\n- [API Reference](https://redux.js.org/api/api-reference)\n\nThe Redux Toolkit docs are available at **https://redux-toolkit.js.org**, including API references and usage guides for all of the APIs included in Redux Toolkit.\n\n## Learn Redux\n\n### Redux Essentials Tutorial\n\nThe [**Redux Essentials tutorial**](https://redux.js.org/tutorials/essentials/part-1-overview-concepts) is a \"top-down\" tutorial that teaches \"how to use Redux the right way\", using our latest recommended APIs and best practices. We recommend starting there.\n\n### Redux Fundamentals Tutorial\n\nThe [**Redux Fundamentals tutorial**](https://redux.js.org/tutorials/fundamentals/part-1-overview) is a \"bottom-up\" tutorial that teaches \"how Redux works\" from first principles and without any abstractions, and why standard Redux usage patterns exist.\n\n### Help and Discussion\n\nThe **[#redux channel](https://discord.gg/0ZcbPKXt5bZ6au5t)** of the **[Reactiflux Discord community](https://www.reactiflux.com)** is our official resource for all questions related to learning and using Redux. Reactiflux is a great place to hang out, ask questions, and learn - please come and join us there!\n\n## Before Proceeding Further\n\nRedux is a valuable tool for organizing your state, but you should also consider whether it's appropriate for your situation. Please don't use Redux just because someone said you should - instead, please take some time to understand the potential benefits and tradeoffs of using it.\n\nHere are some suggestions on when it makes sense to use Redux:\n\n- You have reasonable amounts of data changing over time\n- You need a single source of truth for your state\n- You find that keeping all your state in a top-level component is no longer sufficient\n\nYes, these guidelines are subjective and vague, but this is for a good reason. The point at which you should integrate Redux into your application is different for every user and different for every application.\n\n> **For more thoughts on how Redux is meant to be used, please see:**<br>\n>\n> - **[When (and when not) to reach for Redux](https://changelog.com/posts/when-and-when-not-to-reach-for-redux)**\n> - **[You Might Not Need Redux](https://medium.com/@dan_abramov/you-might-not-need-redux-be46360cf367)**<br>\n> - **[The Tao of Redux, Part 1 - Implementation and Intent](https://blog.isquaredsoftware.com/2017/05/idiomatic-redux-tao-of-redux-part-1/)**<br>\n> - **[The Tao of Redux, Part 2 - Practice and Philosophy](https://blog.isquaredsoftware.com/2017/05/idiomatic-redux-tao-of-redux-part-2/)**\n> - **[Redux FAQ](https://redux.js.org/faq)**\n\n## Basic Example\n\nThe whole global state of your app is stored in an object tree inside a single _store_.\nThe only way to change the state tree is to create an _action_, an object describing what happened, and _dispatch_ it to the store.\nTo specify how state gets updated in response to an action, you write pure _reducer_ functions that calculate a new state based on the old state and the action.\n\nRedux Toolkit simplifies the process of writing Redux logic and setting up the store. With Redux Toolkit, the basic app logic looks like:\n\n```js\nimport { createSlice, configureStore } from '@reduxjs/toolkit'\n\nconst counterSlice = createSlice({\n  name: 'counter',\n  initialState: {\n    value: 0\n  },\n  reducers: {\n    incremented: state => {\n      // Redux Toolkit allows us to write \"mutating\" logic in reducers. It\n      // doesn't actually mutate the state because it uses the Immer library,\n      // which detects changes to a \"draft state\" and produces a brand new\n      // immutable state based off those changes\n      state.value += 1\n    },\n    decremented: state => {\n      state.value -= 1\n    }\n  }\n})\n\nexport const { incremented, decremented } = counterSlice.actions\n\nconst store = configureStore({\n  reducer: counterSlice.reducer\n})\n\n// Can still subscribe to the store\nstore.subscribe(() => console.log(store.getState()))\n\n// Still pass action objects to `dispatch`, but they're created for us\nstore.dispatch(incremented())\n// {value: 1}\nstore.dispatch(incremented())\n// {value: 2}\nstore.dispatch(decremented())\n// {value: 1}\n```\n\nRedux Toolkit allows us to write shorter logic that's easier to read, while still following the original core Redux behavior and data flow.\n\n## Logo\n\nYou can find the official logo [on
